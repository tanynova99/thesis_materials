In the seventies, it was punk music\\nthat drove the whole generation. In the eighties, it was probably money. But for my generation of people, software is the interface\\nto our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically, radically\\nmore diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical\\nand lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things\\nthat they can tinker and turn around and twist,\\nand so forth. My personal journey into the world\\nof programming and technology started at the tender age of 14. I had this mad teenage crush\\non an older man, and the older man in question\\njust happened to be the then Vice President\\nof the United States, Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single\\nteenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow\\nexpress all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here. And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook,\\nthere was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express\\nall of this longing and loving. And that is how programming\\nstarted for me. It started as a means of self-expression. Just like when I was smaller,\\nI would use crayons and legos. And when I was older, I would use\\nguitar lessons and theater plays. But then, there were other boys,\\nother things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers\\nare boring and technical and lonely. Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good\\nat concentrating on things and being exact and they ask\\namazing questions like, \\\"What?\\\" and \\\"Why?\\\"\\nand \\\"How?\\\" and \\\"What if?\\\" And they don't know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science\\nis this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed\\nfrom everyday life as, say, nuclear physics. And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax\\nand controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community,\\nwe've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers\\nof abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer\\nhave any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids\\nhow the human body works, we teach them how\\nthe combustion engine functions and we even tell them\\nthat if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks, \\\"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?\\\" Or, \\\"How does the computer know\\nwhat happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?\\\" Or, \\\"Linda, is Internet a place?\\\" We adults, we grow oddly silent. \\\"It's magic,\\\" some of us say. 'It's too complicated,\\\" the others say. Well, it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened\\nreally, really, really fast. Computer scientists built\\nthese amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them\\nvery, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak\\nto the computers so that we don't know\\nhow to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces. And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating\\nFrench irregular verbs, I was actually practicing\\nmy pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following\\na sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language\\nbetween English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer, but no one knew it. The kids of today, they tap, swipe\\nand pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools\\nto build with computers, we are raising only consumers\\ninstead of creators. And I believe that,\\nif JavaScript is the new lingua franca, instead of grammar lessons,\\nwe should be teaching poetry classes. This whole quest\\nled me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. She is completely fearless,\\nimaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time\\nI would run into a problem in trying to teach\\nmyself programming like, \\\"What is object-oriented design\\nor what is garbage collection?\\\", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old\\nlittle girl would explain the problem. And I wrote a book about her\\nand I illustrated it and the things\\nRuby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're\\nnot supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems\\nstuck together. And Ruby also introduced\\nme to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want\\nto play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots\\nthat are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient,\\nbut somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes, and so on. In Ruby's world, you learn\\ntechnology through play. And, for instance, computers\\nare really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach\\nloops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move,\\nit goes, \\\"Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump.\\\" And you learn counter loops\\nby repeating that four times. And you learn while loops\\nby repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops\\nby repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) You learn decomposition skills\\nby problem solving flow charts and seeing what went wrong\\nin Ruby's friends' practicalities. You learn that algorithms\\nare much like cupcake recipes. And most of all, you learn\\nthat there are no ready answers. When coming up with the curriculum\\nfor Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids\\nhow they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize\\nplay testing sessions. I have three little stories for you\\nfrom those play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids\\nthese four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. And I would ask, \\\"Which one of these\\ndo you think is a computer?\\\" And the kids would be\\nvery conservative and go, \\\"None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad\\nspends way too much time.\\\" But then we would talk and we would discover\\nthat actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog - a dog\\nmight not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have\\na computer inside of it. And grocery stores, they have\\nso many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system\\nand the burglar alarms. And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. (Laughter) And we go further and I give them these little stickers\\nwith an on/off button on them. And I tell the kids,\\n\\\"Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room\\ninto a computer.\\\" And again, the kids go, \\\"Sounds really hard,\\nI don't know the right answer for this.\\\" But I tell them, \\\"Don't worry, your parents don't know\\nthe right answer, either. They've just started\\nto hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids,\\nyou are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world\\nwhere everything is a computer.\\\" Your washing machine, toothbrush,\\neven your milk bottle. And that you're the last generation\\nthat will remember the computer as a glowing box. And then I had this little girl\\nwho came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, \\\"This bicycle lamp,\\nif it were a computer, it would change colors.\\\" And I said, \\\"That's a really good idea,\\nwhat else could it do?\\\" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, \\\"If this bicycle lamp\\nwere a computer, we could go on a biking trip\\nwith my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp\\ncould also be a movie projector.\\\" And that's the moment I'm looking for, not the moment when the kid writes\\nthe prefect Ruby array, the moment when the kid realizes that the world\\nis definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way\\nof making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us\\ncan be a part of that change. Final story, we also built a computer, the glowing box,\\nthe archaic glowing box. And we got to know the bossy CPU\\nand the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we've assembled\\nour computer together, we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world\\nis to be an astronaut. And the boy, he has\\nthese huge headphones on and he's completely immersed\\nin his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary\\nnavigation application. And his father, the lone astronaut\\nin the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father\\nsafely back to earth. And these kids are going to have\\na profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology. Finally, the more approachable,\\nthe more inclusive, and the more diverse\\nwe make the world of technology, the more colorful and better\\nthe world will look like. Because disruption\\ndoesn't start with technology. Disruption starts\\nwith the people with a vision. And computer science, and programming\\nand technology the very DNA of all of these things\\nis humanity. Computers, after all,\\nthey used to be humans who were really, really good\\nat calculating things. And still today, programmers\\ndon't write the code only for the machine to execute. They write the code for other\\nprogrammers to read and build upon. So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made\\ndon't only include the twentysomething-year-old\\nSilicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls\\nand Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where\\nthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent\\nreality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic\\nand brave about technology. They embrace the powers\\nand the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology\\nthat is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird. When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings\\nin Moominvalley. In the afternoons,\\nI would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings,\\nI would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out\\nto be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories, I do them with code. Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules\\nand paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing\\nwith the pure power of logic. And that probably makes me a poet. Thank you. (Applause)\",\n          \"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960. I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people. In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about \\\"the West\\\" and \\\"the Developing World.\\\" But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course, there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. (Laughter) So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have. And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in 2010. And what will happen in the future? Well, I'm going to project into 2050. I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did. All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent. [But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically. And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion? What about the poorest two billion here? Will they move on? Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end. Here [among the poorest], population is growing. So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening. Because we already have this [growth] in process. But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050. We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families. The year is 1960. And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened? I start the world. Here we go. Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing? They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing. [When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families]. Look, Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here? They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen? Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious \\\"possibilist.\\\" It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty, and global governance, the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life. This will not happen [again]. The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. (Applause)\",\n          \"I was born during a war that still engulfs\\nmy country, Afghanistan. When I was growing up,\\nviolence was all around me. I remember sitting\\nin my living room with my family when a distant thud\\nwould jerk us all out of our seats. As the sound of the rockets\\ncame closer and closer, our bodies would coil and freeze. My grandmother would take charge\\nof her terrified flock and shepherd us into a room\\nin the back of the house. No less exposed, but to us,\\nit somehow felt safer. I'd cling to my granny and clench my fists wondering why this was happening to us. I clearly remember\\nmy little brother's face wincing every time we heard a rocket fall. It was this violence, this war that still goes on today, which forced my family to leave our home. We left early one morning\\nnot knowing where we would end up. Along the way, there was more violence. We drove on roads with landmines, and everywhere we went,\\nthere was hostility. The overriding memory\\nin my body of those years is of feeling unsafe. Feeling as though something terrible\\nwould happen to me or to my family. We worried about our friends\\nand family back home. My grandmother was still in Kabul,\\nand I missed her terribly. I'd go to bed at night\\nand say the prayers she taught me to pray for her safety. We wanted nothing more\\nthan to go back home. But when the Taliban took over\\nthe country in 1996, my parents realized\\nthat was no longer an option. So after four years of living in exile, we sought asylum in the UK\\nand began a new life. I started going to school. And almost 25 years later,\\nI'm standing here with you. I'm now working to help others\\novercome devastation by war. To overcome the trauma\\nof being expendable. In my work, I see how living under constant\\nthreat of violence and feeling unsafe can affect people, even when they manage to get out. War leaves a physical legacy in our body, our mind and in our spirit. When I tell people about my life, they sometimes say\\nit's a remarkable story. But this is not true. Millions of people are living\\nthrough war and displacement, trying to survive. For these people, like my family, the dream isn't to get rich or to go on vacations\\nor to buy that perfect house. They have a modest, yet somehow still extravagant\\ndream of being safe. They dream of a day\\nwhen they can go to the market without the fear of violence. Or send their kids to school without being afraid for their lives. War is dislocating. It gets inside your body\\nand makes you into a thing, a corpse. It can dislodge empathy, hope and joy and replace them with fear. The fear that comes from living\\nin the violence of war can break social bonds, disbanding the very communities\\nwe rely on for safety. Women and children I work with\\ncomplain about pain in their body. Children as young as three or four\\ntalk about hurt in their bellies and not because they're hungry. It's a pain I know well. A constant, dull ache all over your body, and it feels as though nothing\\ncan alleviate it. People have nightmares\\nand experience overwhelming emotions: grief, sadness and anger. \\\"Why did I deserve this,\\\" they wonder. This is the situation facing 84 million\\nforcibly displaced people. And according to UNHCR,\\nmore than half are women and children. What's even more startling is the number of people\\nliving in active conflict zones. According to Save the Children, 420 million children are growing up\\nin places where violence is the norm. These are families and children\\nsubject to forces they cannot control. Yet war and violence don't become normal. The stress and trauma experienced\\nby people who go through war is itself deadly. Illnesses like cancer, diabetes and heart disease have been linked to trauma\\nand chronic stress. But it's the psychic pain\\nthat affects people the most. Depression, PTSD\\nand other psychiatric disorders affect a significant percentage\\nof people who go through war. I was shocked when I learned\\nthat since 9/11, four times more US soldiers\\nhave taken their own lives than died in combat. Reconciling to normal life\\nafter you've seen life-shattering war can be the hardest of tasks\\nfor a human being. But mental health and healing\\nare often overlooked when supporting people\\nwho have survived war. And that's why I set up\\nRefugee Trauma Initiative, to help support the mental health\\nof those affected by war and displacement. Our organization is one of several\\naround the world that helps people so they can begin to feel safe again. When feeling safe is splintered and you feel unsafe and unseen, we work to help bring\\nthe internal safe system back online. We create spaces where people can convene and heal as a community. In our groups, men, women and children\\nreconnect with their bodies, have the space to express\\nwhat they are feeling, and most importantly, reconnect with others. We use art, mindfulness, dance and storytelling to help make sense of the dislocating\\nexperiences of violence and of being forced to leave your home. And everything that we do\\nis underpinned by value-based practice. We practice understanding, curiosity and respect to everyone\\nwho comes through the door. We recognize and acknowledge their trauma without pathologizing or medicalizing\\ntheir very normal human reaction to the reckless violence\\nthey've experienced. And we recognize that these experiences\\nare the result of systemic injustice and oppression that often\\nhave colonial roots, which has dehumanized\\nand killed people for centuries. At the heart of our work is a simple\\nyet fundamental notion that feelings of safety are inextricably tied to feeling\\nconnected to a community. A community where you feel\\nworthy and seen. Where your suffering\\nwill be recognized and cared for, where you can experience belonging. Understanding how violence and conflict\\naffects and changes people is more important than ever. Our world is embroiled\\nin multiple chronic conflicts that seem to have no end in sight. Since 1945, there have been 150\\nconflicts around the world, and the overwhelming majority\\nof casualties have been civilians. We can't talk about this human toll of war without talking about the war industry. The war on terror over the last 20 years\\nunleashed a new kind of violence, displacing 38 million people. This is a war that made\\ndrone warfare the norm. Drones enable automated extermination. As we are moving closer and closer\\ntowards automation of war, what happens when we outsource violence, the extinguishing of a human life, to a computer? What happens to us\\nas an interconnected global community when a machine and not a human decides whether a life is worth something? This is all bleak, but not hopeless. There's always room to adjust\\nour trajectory to a better future. I'm standing here in the most powerful\\ncountry in the world, a citizen of the United Kingdom, two countries that have long\\nheld power over war and peace. And the first thing that we can do is demand that our governments\\nstop investing in mass destruction. At a time when we need to invest\\nin tackling climate change and in health care, our governments are financing\\nweapons and drones. Every vote that we cast should be\\nagainst weapons of mass destruction, against automation of war. (Applause) And you can do something\\nin your own community. Right now, there are literally\\nmillions of Afghans who are brutally forced\\nto leave their home. Like them, there are Syrians,\\nIraqis, Burundians who all have to deal with the fallout\\nof war and displacement. And the antidote to their suffering\\nlies in the kindness and connection of the communities\\nwhere they find themselves. If they can feel safe there, they can begin to heal and start a new life. It's sometimes hard for us to see that the answers to some of the most\\ncomplicated problems in the world lie in the simplest of human actions. It may sound too easy that a good neighbor can help\\nto heal the wounds of war. But in my experience, this is true. Before we landed in London,\\nafter months of hardship, we stopped in a poor neighborhood\\nof a town in Central Asia. I was forlorn, grief stricken and not yet able to imagine\\na future without violence. One day, a neighborhood teacher\\nknocked on our door. When we opened the door, we saw a kindly middle-aged woman carrying a box of pens, colored pencils, paper and children's books. She asked my parents if she could come in\\nand spend time with us. They let her in, and from that day, she visited us most days after school. When I told her that I desperately\\nwanted to go to school, she took me to her classroom, where the girls had prepared gifts. They taught me how to sing a song. It wasn't long before we had to move on, and once we left, I never saw her again. But what she did\\nmade me feel valued and safe. The memory of that experience\\nhad left a blueprint of what it felt to inhabit my body, if only for a moment, without fear. A memory of joy and belonging. And to this day, when I feel the opposite, I can close my eyes\\nand feel that connection. And it carries me through the dark days. Thank you.

In the seventies, it was punk music\\nthat drove the whole generation. In the eighties, it was probably money. But for my generation of people, software is the interface\\nto our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically, radically\\nmore diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical\\nand lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things\\nthat they can tinker and turn around and twist,\\nand so forth. My personal journey into the world\\nof programming and technology started at the tender age of 14. I had this mad teenage crush\\non an older man, and the older man in question\\njust happened to be the then Vice President\\nof the United States, Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single\\nteenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow\\nexpress all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here. And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook,\\nthere was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express\\nall of this longing and loving. And that is how programming\\nstarted for me. It started as a means of self-expression. Just like when I was smaller,\\nI would use crayons and legos. And when I was older, I would use\\nguitar lessons and theater plays. But then, there were other boys,\\nother things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers\\nare boring and technical and lonely. Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good\\nat concentrating on things and being exact and they ask\\namazing questions like, \\\"What?\\\" and \\\"Why?\\\"\\nand \\\"How?\\\" and \\\"What if?\\\" And they don't know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science\\nis this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed\\nfrom everyday life as, say, nuclear physics. And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax\\nand controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community,\\nwe've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers\\nof abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer\\nhave any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids\\nhow the human body works, we teach them how\\nthe combustion engine functions and we even tell them\\nthat if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks, \\\"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?\\\" Or, \\\"How does the computer know\\nwhat happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?\\\" Or, \\\"Linda, is Internet a place?\\\" We adults, we grow oddly silent. \\\"It's magic,\\\" some of us say. 'It's too complicated,\\\" the others say. Well, it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened\\nreally, really, really fast. Computer scientists built\\nthese amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them\\nvery, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak\\nto the computers so that we don't know\\nhow to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces. And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating\\nFrench irregular verbs, I was actually practicing\\nmy pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following\\na sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language\\nbetween English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer, but no one knew it. The kids of today, they tap, swipe\\nand pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools\\nto build with computers, we are raising only consumers\\ninstead of creators. And I believe that,\\nif JavaScript is the new lingua franca, instead of grammar lessons,\\nwe should be teaching poetry classes. This whole quest\\nled me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. She is completely fearless,\\nimaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time\\nI would run into a problem in trying to teach\\nmyself programming like, \\\"What is object-oriented design\\nor what is garbage collection?\\\", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old\\nlittle girl would explain the problem. And I wrote a book about her\\nand I illustrated it and the things\\nRuby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're\\nnot supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems\\nstuck together. And Ruby also introduced\\nme to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want\\nto play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots\\nthat are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient,\\nbut somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes, and so on. In Ruby's world, you learn\\ntechnology through play. And, for instance, computers\\nare really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach\\nloops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move,\\nit goes, \\\"Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump.\\\" And you learn counter loops\\nby repeating that four times. And you learn while loops\\nby repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops\\nby repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) You learn decomposition skills\\nby problem solving flow charts and seeing what went wrong\\nin Ruby's friends' practicalities. You learn that algorithms\\nare much like cupcake recipes. And most of all, you learn\\nthat there are no ready answers. When coming up with the curriculum\\nfor Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids\\nhow they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize\\nplay testing sessions. I have three little stories for you\\nfrom those play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids\\nthese four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. And I would ask, \\\"Which one of these\\ndo you think is a computer?\\\" And the kids would be\\nvery conservative and go, \\\"None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad\\nspends way too much time.\\\" But then we would talk and we would discover\\nthat actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog - a dog\\nmight not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have\\na computer inside of it. And grocery stores, they have\\nso many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system\\nand the burglar alarms. And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. (Laughter) And we go further and I give them these little stickers\\nwith an on/off button on them. And I tell the kids,\\n\\\"Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room\\ninto a computer.\\\" And again, the kids go, \\\"Sounds really hard,\\nI don't know the right answer for this.\\\" But I tell them, \\\"Don't worry, your parents don't know\\nthe right answer, either. They've just started\\nto hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids,\\nyou are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world\\nwhere everything is a computer.\\\" Your washing machine, toothbrush,\\neven your milk bottle. And that you're the last generation\\nthat will remember the computer as a glowing box. And then I had this little girl\\nwho came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, \\\"This bicycle lamp,\\nif it were a computer, it would change colors.\\\" And I said, \\\"That's a really good idea,\\nwhat else could it do?\\\" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, \\\"If this bicycle lamp\\nwere a computer, we could go on a biking trip\\nwith my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp\\ncould also be a movie projector.\\\" And that's the moment I'm looking for, not the moment when the kid writes\\nthe prefect Ruby array, the moment when the kid realizes that the world\\nis definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way\\nof making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us\\ncan be a part of that change. Final story, we also built a computer, the glowing box,\\nthe archaic glowing box. And we got to know the bossy CPU\\nand the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we've assembled\\nour computer together, we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world\\nis to be an astronaut. And the boy, he has\\nthese huge headphones on and he's completely immersed\\nin his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary\\nnavigation application. And his father, the lone astronaut\\nin the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father\\nsafely back to earth. And these kids are going to have\\na profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology. Finally, the more approachable,\\nthe more inclusive, and the more diverse\\nwe make the world of technology, the more colorful and better\\nthe world will look like. Because disruption\\ndoesn't start with technology. Disruption starts\\nwith the people with a vision. And computer science, and programming\\nand technology the very DNA of all of these things\\nis humanity. Computers, after all,\\nthey used to be humans who were really, really good\\nat calculating things. And still today, programmers\\ndon't write the code only for the machine to execute. They write the code for other\\nprogrammers to read and build upon. So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made\\ndon't only include the twentysomething-year-old\\nSilicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls\\nand Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where\\nthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent\\nreality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic\\nand brave about technology. They embrace the powers\\nand the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology\\nthat is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird. When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings\\nin Moominvalley. In the afternoons,\\nI would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings,\\nI would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out\\nto be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories, I do them with code. Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules\\nand paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing\\nwith the pure power of logic. And that probably makes me a poet. Thank you. (Applause)\",\n          \"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960. I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people. In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about \\\"the West\\\" and \\\"the Developing World.\\\" But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course, there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. (Laughter) So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have. And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in 2010. And what will happen in the future? Well, I'm going to project into 2050. I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did. All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent. [But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically. And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion? What about the poorest two billion here? Will they move on? Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end. Here [among the poorest], population is growing. So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening. Because we already have this [growth] in process. But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050. We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families. The year is 1960. And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened? I start the world. Here we go. Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing? They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing. [When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families]. Look, Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here? They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen? Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious \\\"possibilist.\\\" It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty, and global governance, the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life. This will not happen [again]. The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. (Applause)\",\n          \"I was born during a war that still engulfs\\nmy country, Afghanistan. When I was growing up,\\nviolence was all around me. I remember sitting\\nin my living room with my family when a distant thud\\nwould jerk us all out of our seats. As the sound of the rockets\\ncame closer and closer, our bodies would coil and freeze. My grandmother would take charge\\nof her terrified flock and shepherd us into a room\\nin the back of the house. No less exposed, but to us,\\nit somehow felt safer. I'd cling to my granny and clench my fists wondering why this was happening to us. I clearly remember\\nmy little brother's face wincing every time we heard a rocket fall. It was this violence, this war that still goes on today, which forced my family to leave our home. We left early one morning\\nnot knowing where we would end up. Along the way, there was more violence. We drove on roads with landmines, and everywhere we went,\\nthere was hostility. The overriding memory\\nin my body of those years is of feeling unsafe. Feeling as though something terrible\\nwould happen to me or to my family. We worried about our friends\\nand family back home. My grandmother was still in Kabul,\\nand I missed her terribly. I'd go to bed at night\\nand say the prayers she taught me to pray for her safety. We wanted nothing more\\nthan to go back home. But when the Taliban took over\\nthe country in 1996, my parents realized\\nthat was no longer an option. So after four years of living in exile, we sought asylum in the UK\\nand began a new life. I started going to school. And almost 25 years later,\\nI'm standing here with you. I'm now working to help others\\novercome devastation by war. To overcome the trauma\\nof being expendable. In my work, I see how living under constant\\nthreat of violence and feeling unsafe can affect people, even when they manage to get out. War leaves a physical legacy in our body, our mind and in our spirit. When I tell people about my life, they sometimes say\\nit's a remarkable story. But this is not true. Millions of people are living\\nthrough war and displacement, trying to survive. For these people, like my family, the dream isn't to get rich or to go on vacations\\nor to buy that perfect house. They have a modest, yet somehow still extravagant\\ndream of being safe. They dream of a day\\nwhen they can go to the market without the fear of violence. Or send their kids to school without being afraid for their lives. War is dislocating. It gets inside your body\\nand makes you into a thing, a corpse. It can dislodge empathy, hope and joy and replace them with fear. The fear that comes from living\\nin the violence of war can break social bonds, disbanding the very communities\\nwe rely on for safety. Women and children I work with\\ncomplain about pain in their body. Children as young as three or four\\ntalk about hurt in their bellies and not because they're hungry. It's a pain I know well. A constant, dull ache all over your body, and it feels as though nothing\\ncan alleviate it. People have nightmares\\nand experience overwhelming emotions: grief, sadness and anger. \\\"Why did I deserve this,\\\" they wonder. This is the situation facing 84 million\\nforcibly displaced people. And according to UNHCR,\\nmore than half are women and children. What's even more startling is the number of people\\nliving in active conflict zones. According to Save the Children, 420 million children are growing up\\nin places where violence is the norm. These are families and children\\nsubject to forces they cannot control. Yet war and violence don't become normal. The stress and trauma experienced\\nby people who go through war is itself deadly. Illnesses like cancer, diabetes and heart disease have been linked to trauma\\nand chronic stress. But it's the psychic pain\\nthat affects people the most. Depression, PTSD\\nand other psychiatric disorders affect a significant percentage\\nof people who go through war. I was shocked when I learned\\nthat since 9/11, four times more US soldiers\\nhave taken their own lives than died in combat. Reconciling to normal life\\nafter you've seen life-shattering war can be the hardest of tasks\\nfor a human being. But mental health and healing\\nare often overlooked when supporting people\\nwho have survived war. And that's why I set up\\nRefugee Trauma Initiative, to help support the mental health\\nof those affected by war and displacement. Our organization is one of several\\naround the world that helps people so they can begin to feel safe again. When feeling safe is splintered and you feel unsafe and unseen, we work to help bring\\nthe internal safe system back online. We create spaces where people can convene and heal as a community. In our groups, men, women and children\\nreconnect with their bodies, have the space to express\\nwhat they are feeling, and most importantly, reconnect with others. We use art, mindfulness, dance and storytelling to help make sense of the dislocating\\nexperiences of violence and of being forced to leave your home. And everything that we do\\nis underpinned by value-based practice. We practice understanding, curiosity and respect to everyone\\nwho comes through the door. We recognize and acknowledge their trauma without pathologizing or medicalizing\\ntheir very normal human reaction to the reckless violence\\nthey've experienced. And we recognize that these experiences\\nare the result of systemic injustice and oppression that often\\nhave colonial roots, which has dehumanized\\nand killed people for centuries. At the heart of our work is a simple\\nyet fundamental notion that feelings of safety are inextricably tied to feeling\\nconnected to a community. A community where you feel\\nworthy and seen. Where your suffering\\nwill be recognized and cared for, where you can experience belonging. Understanding how violence and conflict\\naffects and changes people is more important than ever. Our world is embroiled\\nin multiple chronic conflicts that seem to have no end in sight. Since 1945, there have been 150\\nconflicts around the world, and the overwhelming majority\\nof casualties have been civilians. We can't talk about this human toll of war without talking about the war industry. The war on terror over the last 20 years\\nunleashed a new kind of violence, displacing 38 million people. This is a war that made\\ndrone warfare the norm. Drones enable automated extermination. As we are moving closer and closer\\ntowards automation of war, what happens when we outsource violence, the extinguishing of a human life, to a computer? What happens to us\\nas an interconnected global community when a machine and not a human decides whether a life is worth something? This is all bleak, but not hopeless. There's always room to adjust\\nour trajectory to a better future. I'm standing here in the most powerful\\ncountry in the world, a citizen of the United Kingdom, two countries that have long\\nheld power over war and peace. And the first thing that we can do is demand that our governments\\nstop investing in mass destruction. At a time when we need to invest\\nin tackling climate change and in health care, our governments are financing\\nweapons and drones. Every vote that we cast should be\\nagainst weapons of mass destruction, against automation of war. (Applause) And you can do something\\nin your own community. Right now, there are literally\\nmillions of Afghans who are brutally forced\\nto leave their home. Like them, there are Syrians,\\nIraqis, Burundians who all have to deal with the fallout\\nof war and displacement. And the antidote to their suffering\\nlies in the kindness and connection of the communities\\nwhere they find themselves. If they can feel safe there, they can begin to heal and start a new life. It's sometimes hard for us to see that the answers to some of the most\\ncomplicated problems in the world lie in the simplest of human actions. It may sound too easy that a good neighbor can help\\nto heal the wounds of war. But in my experience, this is true. Before we landed in London,\\nafter months of hardship, we stopped in a poor neighborhood\\nof a town in Central Asia. I was forlorn, grief stricken and not yet able to imagine\\na future without violence. One day, a neighborhood teacher\\nknocked on our door. When we opened the door, we saw a kindly middle-aged woman carrying a box of pens, colored pencils, paper and children's books. She asked my parents if she could come in\\nand spend time with us. They let her in, and from that day, she visited us most days after school. When I told her that I desperately\\nwanted to go to school, she took me to her classroom, where the girls had prepared gifts. They taught me how to sing a song. It wasn't long before we had to move on, and once we left, I never saw her again. But what she did\\nmade me feel valued and safe. The memory of that experience\\nhad left a blueprint of what it felt to inhabit my body, if only for a moment, without fear. A memory of joy and belonging. And to this day, when I feel the opposite, I can close my eyes\\nand feel that connection. And it carries me through the dark days. Thank you.

My personal journey into the world\\nof programming and technology started at the tender age of 14. I had this mad teenage crush\\non an older man, and the older man in question\\njust happened to be the then Vice President\\nof the United States, Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single\\nteenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow\\nexpress all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here. And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook,\\nthere was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express\\nall of this longing and loving. And that is how programming\\nstarted for me. It started as a means of self-expression. Just like when I was smaller,\\nI would use crayons and legos. And when I was older, I would use\\nguitar lessons and theater plays. But then, there were other boys,\\nother things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers\\nare boring and technical and lonely. Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good\\nat concentrating on things and being exact and they ask\\namazing questions like, \\\"What?\\\" and \\\"Why?\\\"\\nand \\\"How?\\\" and \\\"What if?\\\" And they don't know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science\\nis this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed\\nfrom everyday life as, say, nuclear physics. And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax\\nand controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community,\\nwe've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers\\nof abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer\\nhave any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids\\nhow the human body works, we teach them how\\nthe combustion engine functions and we even tell them\\nthat if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks, \\\"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?\\\" Or, \\\"How does the computer know\\nwhat happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?\\\" Or, \\\"Linda, is Internet a place?\\\" We adults, we grow oddly silent. \\\"It's magic,\\\" some of us say. 'It's too complicated,\\\" the others say. Well, it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened\\nreally, really, really fast. Computer scientists built\\nthese amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them\\nvery, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak\\nto the computers so that we don't know\\nhow to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces. And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating\\nFrench irregular verbs, I was actually practicing\\nmy pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following\\na sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language\\nbetween English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer, but no one knew it. The kids of today, they tap, swipe\\nand pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools\\nto build with computers, we are raising only consumers\\ninstead of creators. And I believe that,\\nif JavaScript is the new lingua franca, instead of grammar lessons,\\nwe should be teaching poetry classes. This whole quest\\nled me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. She is completely fearless,\\nimaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time\\nI would run into a problem in trying to teach\\nmyself programming like, \\\"What is object-oriented design\\nor what is garbage collection?\\\", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old\\nlittle girl would explain the problem. And I wrote a book about her\\nand I illustrated it and the things\\nRuby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're\\nnot supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems\\nstuck together. And Ruby also introduced\\nme to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want\\nto play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots\\nthat are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient,\\nbut somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes, and so on. In Ruby's world, you learn\\ntechnology through play. And, for instance, computers\\nare really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach\\nloops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move,\\nit goes, \\\"Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump.\\\" And you learn counter loops\\nby repeating that four times. And you learn while loops\\nby repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops\\nby repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) You learn decomposition skills\\nby problem solving flow charts and seeing what went wrong\\nin Ruby's friends' practicalities. You learn that algorithms\\nare much like cupcake recipes. And most of all, you learn\\nthat there are no ready answers. When coming up with the curriculum\\nfor Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids\\nhow they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize\\nplay testing sessions. I have three little stories for you\\nfrom those play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids\\nthese four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. And I would ask, \\\"Which one of these\\ndo you think is a computer?\\\" And the kids would be\\nvery conservative and go, \\\"None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad\\nspends way too much time.\\\" But then we would talk and we would discover\\nthat actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog - a dog\\nmight not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have\\na computer inside of it. And grocery stores, they have\\nso many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system\\nand the burglar alarms. And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. (Laughter) And we go further and I give them these little stickers\\nwith an on/off button on them. And I tell the kids,\\n\\\"Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room\\ninto a computer.\\\" And again, the kids go, \\\"Sounds really hard,\\nI don't know the right answer for this.\\\" But I tell them, \\\"Don't worry, your parents don't know\\nthe right answer, either. They've just started\\nto hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids,\\nyou are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world\\nwhere everything is a computer.\\\" Your washing machine, toothbrush,\\neven your milk bottle. And that you're the last generation\\nthat will remember the computer as a glowing box. And then I had this little girl\\nwho came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, \\\"This bicycle lamp,\\nif it were a computer, it would change colors.\\\" And I said, \\\"That's a really good idea,\\nwhat else could it do?\\\" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, \\\"If this bicycle lamp\\nwere a computer, we could go on a biking trip\\nwith my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp\\ncould also be a movie projector.\\\" And that's the moment I'm looking for, not the moment when the kid writes\\nthe prefect Ruby array, the moment when the kid realizes that the world\\nis definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way\\nof making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us\\ncan be a part of that change. Final story, we also built a computer, the glowing box,\\nthe archaic glowing box. And we got to know the bossy CPU\\nand the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we've assembled\\nour computer together, we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world\\nis to be an astronaut. And the boy, he has\\nthese huge headphones on and he's completely immersed\\nin his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary\\nnavigation application. And his father, the lone astronaut\\nin the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father\\nsafely back to earth. And these kids are going to have\\na profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology. Finally, the more approachable,\\nthe more inclusive, and the more diverse\\nwe make the world of technology, the more colorful and better\\nthe world will look like. Because disruption\\ndoesn't start with technology. Disruption starts\\nwith the people with a vision. And computer science, and programming\\nand technology the very DNA of all of these things\\nis humanity. Computers, after all,\\nthey used to be humans who were really, really good\\nat calculating things. And still today, programmers\\ndon't write the code only for the machine to execute. They write the code for other\\nprogrammers to read and build upon. So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made\\ndon't only include the twentysomething-year-old\\nSilicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls\\nand Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where\\nthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent\\nreality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic\\nand brave about technology. They embrace the powers\\nand the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology\\nthat is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird. When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings\\nin Moominvalley. In the afternoons,\\nI would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings,\\nI would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out\\nto be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories, I do them with code. Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules\\nand paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing\\nwith the pure power of logic. And that probably makes me a poet. Thank you. (Applause)\",\n          \"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960. I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people. In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about \\\"the West\\\" and \\\"the Developing World.\\\" But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course, there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. (Laughter) So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have. And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in 2010. And what will happen in the future? Well, I'm going to project into 2050. I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did. All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent. [But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically. And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion? What about the poorest two billion here? Will they move on? Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end. Here [among the poorest], population is growing. So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening. Because we already have this [growth] in process. But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050. We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families. The year is 1960. And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened? I start the world. Here we go. Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing? They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing. [When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families]. Look, Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here? They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen? Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious \\\"possibilist.\\\" It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty, and global governance, the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life. This will not happen [again]. The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. (Applause)\",\n          \"I was born during a war that still engulfs\\nmy country, Afghanistan. When I was growing up,\\nviolence was all around me. I remember sitting\\nin my living room with my family when a distant thud\\nwould jerk us all out of our seats. As the sound of the rockets\\ncame closer and closer, our bodies would coil and freeze. My grandmother would take charge\\nof her terrified flock and shepherd us into a room\\nin the back of the house. No less exposed, but to us,\\nit somehow felt safer. I'd cling to my granny and clench my fists wondering why this was happening to us. I clearly remember\\nmy little brother's face wincing every time we heard a rocket fall. It was this violence, this war that still goes on today, which forced my family to leave our home. We left early one morning\\nnot knowing where we would end up. Along the way, there was more violence. We drove on roads with landmines, and everywhere we went,\\nthere was hostility. The overriding memory\\nin my body of those years is of feeling unsafe. Feeling as though something terrible\\nwould happen to me or to my family. We worried about our friends\\nand family back home. My grandmother was still in Kabul,\\nand I missed her terribly. I'd go to bed at night\\nand say the prayers she taught me to pray for her safety. We wanted nothing more\\nthan to go back home. But when the Taliban took over\\nthe country in 1996, my parents realized\\nthat was no longer an option. So after four years of living in exile, we sought asylum in the UK\\nand began a new life. I started going to school. And almost 25 years later,\\nI'm standing here with you. I'm now working to help others\\novercome devastation by war. To overcome the trauma\\nof being expendable. In my work, I see how living under constant\\nthreat of violence and feeling unsafe can affect people, even when they manage to get out. War leaves a physical legacy in our body, our mind and in our spirit. When I tell people about my life, they sometimes say\\nit's a remarkable story. But this is not true. Millions of people are living\\nthrough war and displacement, trying to survive. For these people, like my family, the dream isn't to get rich or to go on vacations\\nor to buy that perfect house. They have a modest, yet somehow still extravagant\\ndream of being safe. They dream of a day\\nwhen they can go to the market without the fear of violence. Or send their kids to school without being afraid for their lives. War is dislocating. It gets inside your body\\nand makes you into a thing, a corpse. It can dislodge empathy, hope and joy and replace them with fear. The fear that comes from living\\nin the violence of war can break social bonds, disbanding the very communities\\nwe rely on for safety. Women and children I work with\\ncomplain about pain in their body. Children as young as three or four\\ntalk about hurt in their bellies and not because they're hungry. It's a pain I know well. A constant, dull ache all over your body, and it feels as though nothing\\ncan alleviate it. People have nightmares\\nand experience overwhelming emotions: grief, sadness and anger. \\\"Why did I deserve this,\\\" they wonder. This is the situation facing 84 million\\nforcibly displaced people. And according to UNHCR,\\nmore than half are women and children. What's even more startling is the number of people\\nliving in active conflict zones. According to Save the Children, 420 million children are growing up\\nin places where violence is the norm. These are families and children\\nsubject to forces they cannot control. Yet war and violence don't become normal. The stress and trauma experienced\\nby people who go through war is itself deadly. Illnesses like cancer, diabetes and heart disease have been linked to trauma\\nand chronic stress. But it's the psychic pain\\nthat affects people the most. Depression, PTSD\\nand other psychiatric disorders affect a significant percentage\\nof people who go through war. I was shocked when I learned\\nthat since 9/11, four times more US soldiers\\nhave taken their own lives than died in combat. Reconciling to normal life\\nafter you've seen life-shattering war can be the hardest of tasks\\nfor a human being. But mental health and healing\\nare often overlooked when supporting people\\nwho have survived war. And that's why I set up\\nRefugee Trauma Initiative, to help support the mental health\\nof those affected by war and displacement. Our organization is one of several\\naround the world that helps people so they can begin to feel safe again. When feeling safe is splintered and you feel unsafe and unseen, we work to help bring\\nthe internal safe system back online. We create spaces where people can convene and heal as a community. In our groups, men, women and children\\nreconnect with their bodies, have the space to express\\nwhat they are feeling, and most importantly, reconnect with others. We use art, mindfulness, dance and storytelling to help make sense of the dislocating\\nexperiences of violence and of being forced to leave your home. And everything that we do\\nis underpinned by value-based practice. We practice understanding, curiosity and respect to everyone\\nwho comes through the door. We recognize and acknowledge their trauma without pathologizing or medicalizing\\ntheir very normal human reaction to the reckless violence\\nthey've experienced. And we recognize that these experiences\\nare the result of systemic injustice and oppression that often\\nhave colonial roots, which has dehumanized\\nand killed people for centuries. At the heart of our work is a simple\\nyet fundamental notion that feelings of safety are inextricably tied to feeling\\nconnected to a community. A community where you feel\\nworthy and seen. Where your suffering\\nwill be recognized and cared for, where you can experience belonging. Understanding how violence and conflict\\naffects and changes people is more important than ever. Our world is embroiled\\nin multiple chronic conflicts that seem to have no end in sight. Since 1945, there have been 150\\nconflicts around the world, and the overwhelming majority\\nof casualties have been civilians. We can't talk about this human toll of war without talking about the war industry. The war on terror over the last 20 years\\nunleashed a new kind of violence, displacing 38 million people. This is a war that made\\ndrone warfare the norm. Drones enable automated extermination. As we are moving closer and closer\\ntowards automation of war, what happens when we outsource violence, the extinguishing of a human life, to a computer? What happens to us\\nas an interconnected global community when a machine and not a human decides whether a life is worth something? This is all bleak, but not hopeless. There's always room to adjust\\nour trajectory to a better future. I'm standing here in the most powerful\\ncountry in the world, a citizen of the United Kingdom, two countries that have long\\nheld power over war and peace. And the first thing that we can do is demand that our governments\\nstop investing in mass destruction. At a time when we need to invest\\nin tackling climate change and in health care, our governments are financing\\nweapons and drones. Every vote that we cast should be\\nagainst weapons of mass destruction, against automation of war. (Applause) And you can do something\\nin your own community. Right now, there are literally\\nmillions of Afghans who are brutally forced\\nto leave their home. Like them, there are Syrians,\\nIraqis, Burundians who all have to deal with the fallout\\nof war and displacement. And the antidote to their suffering\\nlies in the kindness and connection of the communities\\nwhere they find themselves. If they can feel safe there, they can begin to heal and start a new life. It's sometimes hard for us to see that the answers to some of the most\\ncomplicated problems in the world lie in the simplest of human actions. It may sound too easy that a good neighbor can help\\nto heal the wounds of war. But in my experience, this is true. Before we landed in London,\\nafter months of hardship, we stopped in a poor neighborhood\\nof a town in Central Asia. I was forlorn, grief stricken and not yet able to imagine\\na future without violence. One day, a neighborhood teacher\\nknocked on our door. When we opened the door, we saw a kindly middle-aged woman carrying a box of pens, colored pencils, paper and children's books. She asked my parents if she could come in\\nand spend time with us. They let her in, and from that day, she visited us most days after school. When I told her that I desperately\\nwanted to go to school, she took me to her classroom, where the girls had prepared gifts. They taught me how to sing a song. It wasn't long before we had to move on, and once we left, I never saw her again. But what she did\\nmade me feel valued and safe. The memory of that experience\\nhad left a blueprint of what it felt to inhabit my body, if only for a moment, without fear. A memory of joy and belonging. And to this day, when I feel the opposite, I can close my eyes\\nand feel that connection. And it carries me through the dark days. Thank you.
