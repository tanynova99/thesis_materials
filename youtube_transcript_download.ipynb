            "['Imagine that you invented a device that can record my memories, my dreams, my ideas, and transmit them to your brain. That would be a game-changing\\ntechnology, right? But in fact, we already\\npossess this device, and it\\'s called human communication system and effective storytelling. To understand how this device works, we have to look into our brains. And we have to formulate the question\\nin a slightly different manner. Now we have to ask how these neuron patterns in my brain that are associated\\nwith my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains. And we think there are two factors\\nthat enable us to communicate. First, your brain is now\\nphysically coupled to the sound wave that I\\'m transmitting to your brain. And second, we developed\\na common neural protocol that enabled us to communicate. So how do we know that? In my lab in Princeton, we bring people to the fMRI scanner\\nand we scan their brains while they are either telling\\nor listening to real-life stories. And to give you a sense\\nof the stimulus we are using, let me play 20 seconds\\nfrom a story that we used, told by a very talented storyteller, Jim O\\'Grady. (Audio) Jim O\\'Grady: So I\\'m banging out\\nmy story and I know it\\'s good, and then I start to make it better -- (Laughter) by adding an element of embellishment. Reporters call this \"making shit up.\" (Laughter) And they recommend\\nagainst crossing that line. But I had just seen the line crossed\\nbetween a high-powered dean and assault with a pastry. And I kinda liked it.\" Uri Hasson: OK, so now\\nlet\\'s look into your brain and see what\\'s happening\\nwhen you listen to these kinds of stories. And let\\'s start simple -- let\\'s start\\nwith one listener and one brain area: the auditory cortex that processes\\nthe sounds that come from the ear. And as you can see,\\nin this particular brain area, the responses are going up and down\\nas the story is unfolding. Now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses\\nin other listeners in the same brain area. And we can ask: How similar are the responses\\nacross all listeners? So here you can see five listeners. And we start to scan their brains\\nbefore the story starts, when they\\'re simply lying in the dark\\nand waiting for the story to begin. As you can see, the brain area is going up and down\\nin each one of them, but the responses are very different, and not in sync. However, immediately\\nas the story is starting, something amazing is happening. (Audio) JO: So I\\'m banging out my story\\nand I know it\\'s good, and then I start to make it -- UH: Suddenly, you can see\\nthat the responses in all of the subjects lock to the story, and now they are going up and down\\nin a very similar way across all listeners. And in fact, this is exactly\\nwhat is happening now in your brains when you listen to my sound speaking. We call this effect \"neural entrainment.\" And to explain to you\\nwhat is neural entrainment, let me first explain\\nwhat is physical entrainment. So, we\\'ll look and see five metronomes. Think of these five metronomes\\nas five brains. And similar to the listeners\\nbefore the story starts, these metronomes are going to click, but they\\'re going to click out of phase. (Clicking) Now see what will happen\\nwhen I connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders. (Clicking) Now these two cylinders start to rotate. This rotation vibration\\nis going through the wood and is going to couple\\nall the metronomes together. And now listen to the click. (Synchronized clicking) This is what you call\\nphysical entrainment. Now let\\'s go back to the brain and ask: What\\'s driving this neural entrainment? Is it simply the sounds\\nthat the speaker is producing? Or maybe it\\'s the words. Or maybe it\\'s the meaning\\nthat the speaker is trying to convey. So to test it, we did\\nthe following experiment. First, we took the story\\nand played it backwards. And that preserved many\\nof the original auditory features, but removed the meaning. And it sounds something like that. (Audio) JO: (Unintelligible) And we flashed colors in the two brains to indicate brain areas that respond\\nvery similarly across people. And as you can see, this incoming sound induced entrainment\\nor alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices\\nthat process the sounds, but it didn\\'t spread\\ndeeper into the brain. Now we can take these sounds\\nand build words out of it. So if we take Jim O\\'Grady\\nand scramble the words, we\\'ll get a list of words. (Audio) JO: ... an animal ...\\nassorted facts ... and right on ... pie man ...\\npotentially ... my stories UH: And you can see that these words\\nstart to induce alignment in early language areas,\\nbut not more than that. Now we can take the words\\nand start to build sentences out of them. (Audio) JO: And they recommend\\nagainst crossing that line. He says: \"Dear Jim,\\nGood story. Nice details. Didn\\'t she only know\\nabout him through me?\" UH: Now you can see that the responses\\nin all the language areas that process the incoming language become aligned or similar\\nacross all listeners. However, only when we use\\nthe full, engaging, coherent story do the responses spread\\ndeeper into the brain into higher-order areas, which include the frontal cortex\\nand the parietal cortex, and make all of them\\nrespond very similarly. And we believe that these responses\\nin higher-order areas are induced or become similar across listeners because of the meaning\\nconveyed by the speaker, and not by words or sound. And if we are right,\\nthere\\'s a strong prediction over here if I tell you the exact same ideas using two very different sets of words, your brain responses\\nwill still be similar. And to test it, we did\\nthe following experiment in my lab. We took the English story and translated it to Russian. Now you have two different sounds\\nand linguistic systems that convey the exact same meaning. And you play the English story\\nto the English listeners and the Russian story\\nto the Russian listeners, and we can compare their responses\\nacross the groups. And when we did that, we didn\\'t see\\nresponses that are similar in auditory cortices in language, because the language\\nand sound are very different. However, you can see\\nthat the responses in high-order areas were still similar\\nacross these two groups. We believe this is because they understood\\nthe story in a very similar way, as we confirmed, using a test\\nafter the story ended. And we think that this alignment\\nis necessary for communication. For example, as you can tell, I am not a native English speaker. I grew up with another language, and the same might be for many\\nof you in the audience. And still, we can communicate. How come? We think we can communicate\\nbecause we have this common code that presents meaning. So far, I\\'ve only talked about\\nwhat\\'s happening in the listener\\'s brain, in your brain, when\\nyou\\'re listening to talks. But what\\'s happening\\nin the speaker\\'s brain, in my brain, when I\\'m speaking to you? To look in the speaker\\'s brain, we asked the speaker\\nto go into the scanner, we scan his brain and then compare his brain responses\\nto the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story. You have to remember that producing speech\\nand comprehending speech are very different processes. Here we\\'re asking: How similar are they? To our surprise, we saw that all these complex\\npatterns within the listeners actually came from the speaker brain. So production and comprehension\\nrely on very similar processes. And we also found the stronger the similarity\\nbetween the listener\\'s brain and the speaker\\'s brain, the better the communication. So I know that if you\\nare completely confused now, and I do hope that this is not the case, your brain responses\\nare very different than mine. But I also know that if you really\\nunderstand me now, then your brain ... and your brain\\n... and your brain are really similar to mine. Now, let\\'s take all\\nthis information together and ask: How can we use it to transmit\\na memory that I have from my brain to your brains? So we did the following experiment. We let people watch,\\nfor the first time in their life, a TV episode from the BBC series\\n\"Sherlock,\" while we scanned their brains. And then we asked them\\nto go back to the scanner and tell the story to another person\\nthat never watched the movie. So let\\'s be specific. Think about this exact scene, when Sherlock is entering\\nthe cab in London driven by the murderer he is looking for. With me, as a viewer, there is a specific brain pattern\\nin my brain when I watch it. Now, the exact same pattern,\\nI can reactivate in my brain again by telling the word:\\nSherlock, London, murderer. And when I\\'m transmitting\\nthese words to your brains now, you have to reconstruct it in your mind. In fact, we see that pattern\\nemerging now in your brains. And we were really surprised to see that the pattern you have\\nnow in your brains when I\\'m describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern\\nI had when I watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner. This starts to tell you\\nabout the mechanism by which we can tell stories\\nand transmit information. Because, for example, now you\\'re listening really hard\\nand trying to understand what I\\'m saying. And I know that it\\'s not easy. But I hope that at one point\\nin the talk we clicked, and you got me. And I think that in a few hours,\\na few days, a few months, you\\'re going to meet someone at a party, and you\\'re going to tell him\\nabout this lecture, and suddenly it will be as if\\nhe is standing now here with us. Now you can see\\nhow we can take this mechanism and try to transmit memories\\nand knowledge across people, which is wonderful, right? But our ability to communicate\\nrelies on our ability to have common ground. Because, for example, if I\\'m going to use the British synonym \"hackney carriage\" instead of \"cab,\" I know that I\\'m going to be misaligned\\nwith most of you in the audience. This alignment depends\\nnot only on our ability to understand the basic concept; it also depends on our ability to develop\\ncommon ground and understanding and shared belief systems. Because we know that in many cases, people understand the exact\\nsame story in very different ways. So to test it in the lab,\\nwe did the following experiment. We took a story by J.D. Salinger, in which a husband lost track\\nof his wife in the middle of a party, and he\\'s calling his best friend, asking,\\n\"Did you see my wife?\" For half of the subjects, we said that the wife was having\\nan affair with the best friend. For the other half, we said that the wife is loyal\\nand the husband is very jealous. This one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed\\nthe wife was having an affair be very similar in these high-order areas and different than the other group. And if one sentence is enough\\nto make your brain similar to people that think like you and very different than people\\nthat think differently than you, think how this effect is going\\nto be amplified in real life, when we are all listening\\nto the exact same news item after being exposed\\nday after day after day to different media channels,\\nlike Fox News or The New York Times, that give us very different\\nperspectives on reality. So let me summarize. If everything worked as planned tonight, I used my ability to vocalize sound\\nto be coupled to your brains. And I used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated\\nwith my memories and ideas into your brains. In this, I start to reveal\\nthe hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate. And we know that in the future\\nit will enable us to improve and facilitate communication. But these studies also reveal that communication relies\\non a common ground. And we have to be\\nreally worried as a society if we lose this common ground\\nand our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong\\nmedia channels take control of the mic, and manipulate and control\\nthe way we all think. And I\\'m not sure how to fix it\\nbecause I\\'m only a scientist. But maybe one way to do it is to go back to the more\\nnatural way of communication, which is a dialogue, in which it\\'s not only me\\nspeaking to you now, but a more natural way of talking, in which I am speaking and I am listening, and together we are trying to come\\nto a common ground and new ideas. Because after all, the people we are coupled to\\ndefine who we are. And our desire to be coupled\\nto another brain is something very basic\\nthat starts at a very early age. So let me finish with an example\\nfrom my own private life that I think is a good example\\nof how coupling to other people is really going to define who we are. This my son Jonathan at a very early age. See how he developed\\na vocal game together with my wife, only from the desire and pure joy\\nof being coupled to another human being. (Both vocalizing) (Laughter) Now, think how the ability of my son to be coupled to us\\nand other people in his life is going to shape the man\\nhe is going to become. And think how you change on a daily basis from the interaction and coupling\\nto other people in your life. So keep being coupled to other people. Keep spreading your ideas, because the sum of all of us\\ntogether, coupled, is greater than our parts. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells? There\\'s still some confusion\\nabout that question, as this is a fairly new field of research. For example, I was talking\\nto one of my colleagues, Robert, who is an oncologist, and he was telling me, \"Sandrine, this is puzzling. Some of my patients that have been told\\nthey are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression.\" And I responded to him, \"Well, from my point of view\\nthat makes sense. The drug you give to your patients\\nthat stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons\\nbeing generated in their brain.\" And then Robert looked at me\\nlike I was crazy and said, \"But Sandrine, these are adult patients -- adults do not grow new nerve cells.\" And much to his surprise, I said,\\n\"Well actually, we do.\" And this is a phenomenon\\nthat we call neurogenesis. [Neurogenesis] Now Robert is not a neuroscientist, and when he went to medical school\\nhe was not taught what we know now -- that the adult brain\\ncan generate new nerve cells. So Robert, you know,\\nbeing the good doctor that he is, wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic\\na little bit better. And I took him for a tour of one of the most exciting\\nparts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis -- and this is the hippocampus. So this is this gray structure\\nin the center of the brain. And what we\\'ve known already\\nfor very long, is that this is important for learning,\\nmemory, mood and emotion. However, what we\\nhave learned more recently is that this is one of the unique\\nstructures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated. And if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in, what you actually see here in blue is a newborn neuron\\nin an adult mouse brain. So when it comes to the human brain -- my colleague Jonas Frisén\\nfrom the Karolinska Institutet, has estimated that we produce\\n700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus. You might think this is not much, compared to the billions\\nof neurons we have. But by the time we turn 50, we will have all exchanged the neurons\\nwe were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons. So why are these new neurons important\\nand what are their functions? First, we know that they\\'re important\\nfor learning and memory. And in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability\\nof the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus, then we block certain memory abilities. And this is especially new and true\\nfor spatial recognition -- so like, how you navigate\\nyour way in the city. We are still learning a lot, and neurons are not only important\\nfor memory capacity, but also for the quality of the memory. And they will have been helpful\\nto add time to our memory and they will help differentiate\\nvery similar memories, like: how do you find your bike that you park at the station\\nevery day in the same area, but in a slightly different position? And more interesting\\nto my colleague Robert is the research we have been doing\\non neurogenesis and depression. So in an animal model of depression, we have seen that we have\\na lower level of neurogenesis. And if we give antidepressants, then we increase the production\\nof these newborn neurons, and we decrease\\nthe symptoms of depression, establishing a clear link\\nbetween neurogenesis and depression. But moreover, if you\\njust block neurogenesis, then you block the efficacy\\nof the antidepressant. So by then, Robert had understood that very likely his patients\\nwere suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer, because the cancer drug had stopped\\nnewborn neurons from being generated. And it will take time\\nto generate new neurons that reach normal functions. So, collectively, now we think\\nwe have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis\\nis a target of choice if we want to improve\\nmemory formation or mood, or even prevent the decline\\nassociated with aging, or associated with stress. So the next question is: can we control neurogenesis? The answer is yes. And we are now going to do a little quiz. I\\'m going to give you a set\\nof behaviors and activities, and you tell me if you think\\nthey will increase neurogenesis or if they will decrease neurogenesis. Are we ready? OK, let\\'s go. So what about learning? Increasing? Yes. Learning will increase the production\\nof these new neurons. How about stress? Yes, stress will decrease the production\\nof new neurons in the hippocampus. How about sleep deprivation? Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis. How about sex? Oh, wow! (Laughter) Yes, you are right, it will increase\\nthe production of new neurons. However, it\\'s all about balance here. We don\\'t want to fall in a situation -- (Laughter) about too much sex\\nleading to sleep deprivation. (Laughter) How about getting older? So the neurogenesis rate\\nwill decrease as we get older, but it is still occurring. And then finally, how about running? I will let you judge that one by yourself. So this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors,\\nRusty Gage from the Salk Institute, showing that the environment\\ncan have an impact on the production of new neurons. And here you see a section\\nof the hippocampus of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage. And the little black dots you see\\nare actually newborn neurons-to-be. And now, you see a section\\nof the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage. So you see the massive increase of the black dots representing\\nthe new neurons-to-be. So activity impacts neurogenesis,\\nbut that\\'s not all. What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons\\nin the hippocampus. So here we have a sample of diet -- of nutrients that have been shown\\nto have efficacy. And I\\'m just going\\nto point a few out to you: Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent\\nwill increase neurogenesis. Intermittent fasting --\\nspacing the time between your meals -- will increase neurogenesis. Intake of flavonoids, which are contained\\nin dark chocolate or blueberries, will increase neurogenesis. Omega-3 fatty acids, present in fatty fish, like salmon, will increase the production\\nof these new neurons. Conversely, a diet rich\\nin high saturated fat will have a negative impact\\non neurogenesis. Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --\\nwill decrease neurogenesis. However, not everything is lost; resveratrol, which is\\ncontained in red wine, has been shown to promote\\nthe survival of these new neurons. So next time you are at a dinner party, you might want to reach for this possibly\\n\"neurogenesis-neutral\" drink. (Laughter) And then finally,\\nlet me point out the last one -- a quirky one. So Japanese groups are fascinated\\nwith food textures, and they have shown that actually\\nsoft diet impairs neurogenesis, as opposed to food that requires\\nmastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food. So all of this data, where we need to look\\nat the cellular level, has been generated using animal models. But this diet has also been given\\nto human participants, and what we could see is that\\nthe diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction\\nas it modulates neurogenesis, such as: calorie restriction\\nwill improve memory capacity, whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate\\nsymptoms of depression -- as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,\\nwhich increase neurogenesis, and also help to decrease\\nthe symptoms of depression. So we think that the effect of diet on mental health, on memory and mood, is actually mediated by the production\\nof the new neurons in the hippocampus. And it\\'s not only what you eat, but it\\'s also the texture\\nof the food, when you eat it and how much of it you eat. On our side -- neuroscientists\\ninterested in neurogenesis -- we need to understand better\\nthe function of these new neurons, and how we can control their survival\\nand their production. We also need to find a way to protect\\nthe neurogenesis of Robert\\'s patients. And on your side -- I leave you in charge\\nof your neurogenesis. Thank you. (Applause) Margaret Heffernan:\\nFantastic research, Sandrine. Now, I told you you changed my life -- I now eat a lot of blueberries. Sandrine Thuret: Very good. MH: I\\'m really interested\\nin the running thing. Do I have to run? Or is it really just\\nabout aerobic exercise, getting oxygen to the brain? Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise? ST: So for the moment, we can\\'t really say\\nif it\\'s just the running itself, but we think that anything that indeed\\nwill increase the production -- or moving the blood flow to the brain, should be beneficial. MH: So I don\\'t have to get\\na running wheel in my office? ST: No, you don\\'t! MH: Oh, what a relief! That\\'s wonderful. Sandrine Thuret, thank you so much. ST: Thank you, Margaret. (Applause)', 'I have a doppelganger. (Laughter) Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the \"Dragonball Z: Android Saga.\" If you look very carefully, you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light. That\\'s exactly what I do -- optical mind control. (Laughter) But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination, my motives are not sinister. I control the brain in order to understand how it works. Now wait a minute, you may say, how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first? Isn\\'t that putting the cart before the horse? Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis. They say, \"If we could record the activity of our neurons, we would understand the brain.\" But think for a moment what that means. Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times, we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns, and that\\'s so difficult, chances are we\\'ll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. Take a look at what brain activity might look like. In this simulation, each black dot is one nerve cell. The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. There\\'s 10,000 neurons here. So you\\'re looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. Your brains are about 100 million times more complicated. Somewhere, in a pattern like this, is you, your perceptions, your emotions, your memories, your plans for the future. But we don\\'t know where, since we don\\'t know how to read the pattern. We don\\'t understand the code used by the brain. To make progress, we need to break the code. But how? An experienced code-breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean, it\\'s essential to be able to play with them, to rearrange them at will. So in this situation too, to decode the information contained in patterns like this, watching alone won\\'t do. We need to rearrange the pattern. In other words, instead of recording the activity of neurons, we need to control it. It\\'s not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some. The more targeted our interventions, the better. And I\\'ll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision. And since I\\'m realistic, rather than grandiose, I don\\'t claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries. But we\\'ll certainly learn a lot. Now, I\\'m by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. It dates back at least 200 years, to Galvani\\'s famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond. Galvani showed that a frog\\'s legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental, nugget of the neural code: that information is written in the form of electrical impulses. Galvani\\'s approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today, despite a number of drawbacks. Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. It\\'s hard to do in animals that run around, and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously. So around the turn of the last century, I started to think, \"Wouldn\\'t it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down?\" So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain, re-engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light, overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. First, it\\'s clearly a non-invasive, wireless form of communication. And second, just as in a radio broadcast, you can communicate with many receivers at once. You don\\'t need to know where these receivers are, and it doesn\\'t matter if these receivers move -- just think of the stereo in your car. It gets even better, for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in DNA. So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function. I hope you\\'ll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept. There\\'s no high-tech gizmos here, just biology revealed through biology. Now let\\'s take a look at these miraculous receivers up close. As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons, we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores. Pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system. But these pores here are special. They are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes. Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor, the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on, and the neuron fires electrical impulses. Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA, we can achieve incredible precision. This is because, although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes, different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells. You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don\\'t. So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore. The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. In this example, each electrical impulse, each deflection on the trace, is caused by a brief pulse of light. And the approach, of course, also works in moving, behaving animals. This is the first ever such experiment, sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani\\'s. It was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student, Susana Lima. Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain expressed the light-activated pore. You\\'re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly. They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position. And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect. The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them, but it can\\'t actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates. Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see, Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. She cut the heads off of her flies. These headless bodies can live for about a day, but they don\\'t do much. They just stand around and groom excessively. So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity. (Laughter) Anyway, as you\\'ll see in a moment, Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what\\'s the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away. They didn\\'t get very far, obviously. Since we took these first steps, the field of optogenetics has exploded. And there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches. And we\\'ve come a long way since Galvani\\'s and Susana\\'s first successes in making animals twitch or jump. We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways, as I\\'ll show you in my last example, which is directed at a familiar question. Life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next. We cope with this pressure by having brains, and within our brains, decision-making centers that I\\'ve called here the \"Actor.\" The Actor implements a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we operate. Our actions change the environment, or context, and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop. Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model, we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject, fruit flies. Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly. The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors, and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them. Here\\'s some such CCTV footage. Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet, it has to make a decision. It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor, or whether to cross the midline and try something new. These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor\\'s policy. Now for an intelligent being like our fly, this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience. We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly\\'s brain contains not only an Actor, but a different group of cells, a \"Critic,\" that provides a running commentary on the Actor\\'s choices. You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain\\'s equivalent of the Catholic Church, if you\\'re an Austrian like me, or the super-ego, if you\\'re Freudian, or your mother, if you\\'re Jewish. (Laughter) Now obviously, the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent. So we set out to identify the cells in the fly\\'s brain that played the role of the Critic. And the logic of our experiment was simple. We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic, we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor into changing its policy. In other words, the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but, in reality, it had not made. So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable. And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices. And whenever they made one of the two choices, chose one odor, in this case the blue one over the orange one, we switched on the lights. If the Critic was among the optically activated cells, the result of this intervention should be a change in policy. The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. Here\\'s what happened in two instances: We\\'re comparing two strains of flies, each of them having about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains, shown here in green on the left and on the right. What\\'s common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. But the identities of the individual dopamine-producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right. Optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences. If you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right, you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet, it marches straight through, as it did before. Its behavior is completely unchanged. But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different. Whenever it comes up to the midpoint, it pauses, it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment, and then it turns around. This means that the policy that the Actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that\\'s in the right half of the chamber. This means that the Critic must have spoken in that animal, and that the Critic must be contained among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left, but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right. Through many such experiments, we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just 12 cells. These 12 cells, as shown here in green, send the output to a brain structure called the \"mushroom body,\" which is shown here in gray. We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic\\'s commentary is the Actor. So this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice. Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies, this makes perfect sense. In fact, it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly. In this electronic toy circuit, the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue LEDs in the center of the board. These LED\\'s are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. Each odor activates a different combination of sensors, which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body. So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly, the Actor, can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy, which is stored in the strengths of the connection, between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly\\'s evasive actions. If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course. If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn. Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off, the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped. In a situation like this, we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy. We have created such a situation, artificially, by turning on the critic with a flash of light. That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again, the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver. I don\\'t know about you, but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind, even if it\\'s the mind of the fly. This is one piece of good news. The other piece of good news, for a scientist at least, is that much remains to be discovered. In the experiments I told you about, we have lifted the identity of the Critic, but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job. Come to think of it, knowing when you\\'re wrong without a teacher, or your mother, telling you, is a very hard problem. There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done, but we still haven\\'t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter. I think we\\'ll get there in the not too distant future. Thank you. (Applause)', 'So I\\'m excited to share a few spicy\\nthoughts on artificial intelligence. But first, let\\'s get philosophical by starting with this quote by Voltaire, an 18th century Enlightenment philosopher, who said, \"Common sense is not so common.\" Turns out this quote\\ncouldn\\'t be more relevant to artificial intelligence today. Despite that, AI\\nis an undeniably powerful tool, beating the world-class \"Go\" champion, acing college admission tests\\nand even passing the bar exam. I’m a computer scientist of 20 years, and I work on artificial intelligence. I am here to demystify AI. So AI today is like a Goliath. It is literally very, very large. It is speculated that the recent ones\\nare trained on tens of thousands of GPUs and a trillion words. Such extreme-scale AI models, often referred to as \"large\\nlanguage models,\" appear to demonstrate sparks of AGI, artificial general intelligence. Except when it makes\\nsmall, silly mistakes, which it often does. Many believe that whatever\\nmistakes AI makes today can be easily fixed with brute force, bigger scale and more resources. What possibly could go wrong? So there are three immediate challenges\\nwe face already at the societal level. First, extreme-scale AI models\\nare so expensive to train, and only a few tech companies\\ncan afford to do so. So we already see\\nthe concentration of power. But what\\'s worse for AI safety, we are now at the mercy\\nof those few tech companies because researchers\\nin the larger community do not have the means to truly inspect\\nand dissect these models. And let\\'s not forget\\ntheir massive carbon footprint and the environmental impact. And then there are these additional\\nintellectual questions. Can AI, without robust common sense,\\nbe truly safe for humanity? And is brute-force scale\\nreally the only way and even the correct way to teach AI? So I’m often asked these days whether it\\'s even feasible\\nto do any meaningful research without extreme-scale compute. And I work at a university\\nand nonprofit research institute, so I cannot afford a massive GPU farm\\nto create enormous language models. Nevertheless, I believe\\nthat there\\'s so much we need to do and can do to make\\nAI sustainable and humanistic. We need to make AI smaller,\\nto democratize it. And we need to make AI safer\\nby teaching human norms and values. Perhaps we can draw an analogy\\nfrom \"David and Goliath,\" here, Goliath being\\nthe extreme-scale language models, and seek inspiration from\\nan old-time classic, \"The Art of War,\" which tells us, in my interpretation, know your enemy, choose your battles,\\nand innovate your weapons. Let\\'s start with the first,\\nknow your enemy, which means we need\\nto evaluate AI with scrutiny. AI is passing the bar exam. Does that mean that AI\\nis robust at common sense? You might assume so, but you never know. So suppose I left five clothes\\nto dry out in the sun, and it took them five hours\\nto dry completely. How long would it take to dry 30 clothes? GPT-4, the newest, greatest\\nAI system says 30 hours. Not good. A different one. I have 12-liter jug and six-liter jug, and I want to measure six liters. How do I do it? Just use the six liter jug, right? GPT-4 spits out some\\nvery elaborate nonsense. (Laughter) Step one, fill the six-liter jug, step two, pour the water\\nfrom six to 12-liter jug, step three, fill the six-liter jug again, step four, very carefully,\\npour the water from six to 12-liter jug. And finally you have six liters\\nof water in the six-liter jug that should be empty by now. (Laughter) OK, one more. Would I get a flat tire\\nby bicycling over a bridge that is suspended over nails,\\nscrews and broken glass? Yes, highly likely, GPT-4 says, presumably because it cannot\\ncorrectly reason that if a bridge is suspended\\nover the broken nails and broken glass, then the surface of the bridge\\ndoesn\\'t touch the sharp objects directly. OK, so how would you feel\\nabout an AI lawyer that aced the bar exam yet randomly fails at such\\nbasic common sense? AI today is unbelievably intelligent\\nand then shockingly stupid. (Laughter) It is an unavoidable side effect\\nof teaching AI through brute-force scale. Some scale optimists might say,\\n“Don’t worry about this. All of these can be easily fixed\\nby adding similar examples as yet more training data for AI.\" But the real question is this. Why should we even do that? You are able to get\\nthe correct answers right away without having to train yourself\\nwith similar examples. Children do not even read\\na trillion words to acquire such a basic level\\nof common sense. So this observation leads us\\nto the next wisdom, choose your battles. So what fundamental questions\\nshould we ask right now and tackle today in order to overcome\\nthis status quo with extreme-scale AI? I\\'ll say common sense\\nis among the top priorities. So common sense has been\\na long-standing challenge in AI. To explain why, let me draw\\nan analogy to dark matter. So only five percent\\nof the universe is normal matter that you can see and interact with, and the remaining 95 percent\\nis dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter is completely invisible, but scientists speculate that it\\'s there\\nbecause it influences the visible world, even including the trajectory of light. So for language, the normal matter\\nis the visible text, and the dark matter is the unspoken\\nrules about how the world works, including naive physics\\nand folk psychology, which influence the way\\npeople use and interpret language. So why is this common sense\\neven important? Well, in a famous thought experiment\\nproposed by Nick Bostrom, AI was asked to produce\\nand maximize the paper clips. And that AI decided to kill humans\\nto utilize them as additional resources, to turn you into paper clips. Because AI didn\\'t have the basic human\\nunderstanding about human values. Now, writing a better\\nobjective and equation that explicitly states:\\n“Do not kill humans” will not work either because AI might go ahead\\nand kill all the trees, thinking that\\'s a perfectly\\nOK thing to do. And in fact, there are\\nendless other things that AI obviously shouldn’t do\\nwhile maximizing paper clips, including: “Don’t spread the fake news,”\\n“Don’t steal,” “Don’t lie,” which are all part of our common sense\\nunderstanding about how the world works. However, the AI field for decades\\nhas considered common sense as a nearly impossible challenge. So much so that when my students\\nand colleagues and I started working on it several years ago,\\nwe were very much discouraged. We’ve been told that it’s a research\\ntopic of ’70s and ’80s; shouldn’t work on it\\nbecause it will never work; in fact, don\\'t even say the word\\nto be taken seriously. Now fast forward to this year, I’m hearing: “Don’t work on it\\nbecause ChatGPT has almost solved it.” And: “Just scale things up\\nand magic will arise, and nothing else matters.” So my position is that giving\\ntrue common sense human-like robots common sense\\nto AI, is still moonshot. And you don’t reach to the Moon by making the tallest building\\nin the world one inch taller at a time. Extreme-scale AI models do acquire an ever-more increasing amount\\nof commonsense knowledge, I\\'ll give you that. But remember, they still stumble\\non such trivial problems that even children can do. So AI today is awfully inefficient. And what if there is an alternative path\\nor path yet to be found? A path that can build on the advancements\\nof the deep neural networks, but without going so extreme\\nwith the scale. So this leads us to our final wisdom: innovate your weapons. In the modern-day AI context, that means innovate\\nyour data and algorithms. OK, so there are, roughly speaking,\\nthree types of data that modern AI is trained on: raw web data, crafted examples\\ncustom developed for AI training, and then human judgments, also known as human\\nfeedback on AI performance. If the AI is only trained\\non the first type, raw web data, which is freely available, it\\'s not good because this data\\nis loaded with racism and sexism and misinformation. So no matter how much of it you use,\\ngarbage in and garbage out. So the newest, greatest AI systems are now powered with the second\\nand third types of data that are crafted and judged\\nby human workers. It\\'s analogous to writing specialized\\ntextbooks for AI to study from and then hiring human tutors\\nto give constant feedback to AI. These are proprietary data, by and large, speculated to cost\\ntens of millions of dollars. We don\\'t know what\\'s in this, but it should be open\\nand publicly available so that we can inspect and ensure\\n[it supports] diverse norms and values. So for this reason,\\nmy teams at UW and AI2 have been working\\non commonsense knowledge graphs as well as moral norm repositories to teach AI basic commonsense\\nnorms and morals. Our data is fully open so that anybody\\ncan inspect the content and make corrections as needed because transparency is the key\\nfor such an important research topic. Now let\\'s think about learning algorithms. No matter how amazing\\nlarge language models are, by design they may not be the best suited to serve\\nas reliable knowledge models. And these language models do acquire\\na vast amount of knowledge, but they do so as a byproduct\\nas opposed to direct learning objective. Resulting in unwanted side effects\\nsuch as hallucinated effects and lack of common sense. Now, in contrast, human learning is never\\nabout predicting which word comes next, but it\\'s really about making\\nsense of the world and learning how the world works. Maybe AI should be taught\\nthat way as well. So as a quest toward more direct\\ncommonsense knowledge acquisition, my team has been investigating\\npotential new algorithms, including symbolic knowledge distillation that can take a very large\\nlanguage model as shown here that I couldn\\'t fit into the screen\\nbecause it\\'s too large, and crunch that down to much smaller\\ncommonsense models using deep neural networks. And in doing so, we also generate,\\nalgorithmically, human-inspectable, symbolic, commonsense\\nknowledge representation, so that people can inspect\\nand make corrections and even use it to train\\nother neural commonsense models. More broadly, we have been tackling\\nthis seemingly impossible giant puzzle of common sense, ranging from physical, social and visual common sense to theory of minds, norms and morals. Each individual piece\\nmay seem quirky and incomplete, but when you step back, it\\'s almost as if these pieces\\nweave together into a tapestry that we call human experience\\nand common sense. We\\'re now entering a new era in which AI is almost like\\na new intellectual species with unique strengths and weaknesses\\ncompared to humans. In order to make this powerful AI sustainable and humanistic, we need to teach AI\\ncommon sense, norms and values. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Look at that. Yejin, please stay one sec. This is so interesting, this idea of common sense. We obviously all really want this\\nfrom whatever\\'s coming. But help me understand. Like, so we\\'ve had this model\\nof a child learning. How does a child gain common sense apart from the accumulation of more input and some, you know, human feedback? What else is there? Yejin Choi: So fundamentally,\\nthere are several things missing, but one of them is, for example, the ability to make hypothesis\\nand make experiments, interact with the world\\nand develop this hypothesis. We abstract away the concepts\\nabout how the world works, and then that\\'s how we truly learn, as opposed to today\\'s language model. Some of them is really\\nnot there quite yet. CA: You use the analogy\\nthat we can’t get to the Moon by extending a building a foot at a time. But the experience\\nthat most of us have had of these language models\\nis not a foot at a time. It\\'s like, the sort of,\\nbreathtaking acceleration. Are you sure that given the pace\\nat which those things are going, each next level seems\\nto be bringing with it what feels kind of like wisdom\\nand knowledge. YC: I totally agree that it\\'s remarkable\\nhow much this scaling things up really enhances the performance\\nacross the board. So there\\'s real learning happening due to the scale of the compute and data. However, there\\'s a quality of learning\\nthat is still not quite there. And the thing is, we don\\'t yet know whether\\nwe can fully get there or not just by scaling things up. And if we cannot, then there\\'s\\nthis question of what else? And then even if we could, do we like this idea of having very,\\nvery extreme-scale AI models that only a few can create and own? CA: I mean, if OpenAI said, you know,\\n\"We\\'re interested in your work, we would like you to help\\nimprove our model,\" can you see any way\\nof combining what you\\'re doing with what they have built? YC: Certainly what I envision will need to build on the advancements\\nof deep neural networks. And it might be that there’s some\\nscale Goldilocks Zone, such that ... I\\'m not imagining that the smaller\\nis the better either, by the way. It\\'s likely that there\\'s right\\namount of scale, but beyond that, the winning recipe\\nmight be something else. So some synthesis of ideas\\nwill be critical here. CA: Yejin Choi, thank you\\nso much for your talk. (Applause)', 'After 13.8 billion years\\nof cosmic history, our universe has woken up and become aware of itself. From a small blue planet, tiny, conscious parts of our universe\\nhave begun gazing out into the cosmos with telescopes, discovering something humbling. We\\'ve discovered that our universe\\nis vastly grander than our ancestors imagined and that life seems to be an almost\\nimperceptibly small perturbation on an otherwise dead universe. But we\\'ve also discovered\\nsomething inspiring, which is that the technology\\nwe\\'re developing has the potential to help life flourish like never before, not just for centuries\\nbut for billions of years, and not just on earth but throughout\\nmuch of this amazing cosmos. I think of the earliest life as \"Life 1.0\" because it was really dumb, like bacteria, unable to learn\\nanything during its lifetime. I think of us humans as \"Life 2.0\"\\nbecause we can learn, which we in nerdy, geek speak, might think of as installing\\nnew software into our brains, like languages and job skills. \"Life 3.0,\" which can design not only\\nits software but also its hardware of course doesn\\'t exist yet. But perhaps our technology\\nhas already made us \"Life 2.1,\" with our artificial knees,\\npacemakers and cochlear implants. So let\\'s take a closer look\\nat our relationship with technology, OK? As an example, the Apollo 11 moon mission\\nwas both successful and inspiring, showing that when we humans\\nuse technology wisely, we can accomplish things\\nthat our ancestors could only dream of. But there\\'s an even more inspiring journey propelled by something\\nmore powerful than rocket engines, where the passengers\\naren\\'t just three astronauts but all of humanity. Let\\'s talk about our collective\\njourney into the future with artificial intelligence. My friend Jaan Tallinn likes to point out\\nthat just as with rocketry, it\\'s not enough to make\\nour technology powerful. We also have to figure out,\\nif we\\'re going to be really ambitious, how to steer it and where we want to go with it. So let\\'s talk about all three\\nfor artificial intelligence: the power, the steering\\nand the destination. Let\\'s start with the power. I define intelligence very inclusively -- simply as our ability\\nto accomplish complex goals, because I want to include both\\nbiological and artificial intelligence. And I want to avoid\\nthe silly carbon-chauvinism idea that you can only be smart\\nif you\\'re made of meat. It\\'s really amazing how the power\\nof AI has grown recently. Just think about it. Not long ago, robots couldn\\'t walk. Now, they can do backflips. Not long ago, we didn\\'t have self-driving cars. Now, we have self-flying rockets. Not long ago, AI couldn\\'t do face recognition. Now, AI can generate fake faces and simulate your face\\nsaying stuff that you never said. Not long ago, AI couldn\\'t beat us at the game of Go. Then, Google DeepMind\\'s AlphaZero AI\\ntook 3,000 years of human Go games and Go wisdom, ignored it all and became the world\\'s best\\nplayer by just playing against itself. And the most impressive feat here\\nwasn\\'t that it crushed human gamers, but that it crushed human AI researchers who had spent decades\\nhandcrafting game-playing software. And AlphaZero crushed human AI researchers\\nnot just in Go but even at chess, which we have been working on since 1950. So all this amazing recent progress in AI\\nreally begs the question: How far will it go? I like to think about this question in terms of this abstract\\nlandscape of tasks, where the elevation represents\\nhow hard it is for AI to do each task at human level, and the sea level represents\\nwhat AI can do today. The sea level is rising\\nas AI improves, so there\\'s a kind of global warming\\ngoing on here in the task landscape. And the obvious takeaway\\nis to avoid careers at the waterfront -- (Laughter) which will soon be\\nautomated and disrupted. But there\\'s a much\\nbigger question as well. How high will the water end up rising? Will it eventually rise\\nto flood everything, matching human intelligence at all tasks. This is the definition\\nof artificial general intelligence -- AGI, which has been the holy grail\\nof AI research since its inception. By this definition, people who say, \"Ah, there will always be jobs\\nthat humans can do better than machines,\" are simply saying\\nthat we\\'ll never get AGI. Sure, we might still choose\\nto have some human jobs or to give humans income\\nand purpose with our jobs, but AGI will in any case\\ntransform life as we know it with humans no longer being\\nthe most intelligent. Now, if the water level does reach AGI, then further AI progress will be driven\\nmainly not by humans but by AI, which means that there\\'s a possibility that further AI progress\\ncould be way faster than the typical human research\\nand development timescale of years, raising the controversial possibility\\nof an intelligence explosion where recursively self-improving AI rapidly leaves human\\nintelligence far behind, creating what\\'s known\\nas superintelligence. Alright, reality check: Are we going to get AGI any time soon? Some famous AI researchers,\\nlike Rodney Brooks, think it won\\'t happen\\nfor hundreds of years. But others, like Google DeepMind\\nfounder Demis Hassabis, are more optimistic and are working to try to make\\nit happen much sooner. And recent surveys have shown\\nthat most AI researchers actually share Demis\\'s optimism, expecting that we will\\nget AGI within decades, so within the lifetime of many of us, which begs the question -- and then what? What do we want the role of humans to be if machines can do everything better\\nand cheaper than us? The way I see it, we face a choice. One option is to be complacent. We can say, \"Oh, let\\'s just build machines\\nthat can do everything we can do and not worry about the consequences. Come on, if we build technology\\nthat makes all humans obsolete, what could possibly go wrong?\" (Laughter) But I think that would be\\nembarrassingly lame. I think we should be more ambitious --\\nin the spirit of TED. Let\\'s envision a truly inspiring\\nhigh-tech future and try to steer towards it. This brings us to the second part\\nof our rocket metaphor: the steering. We\\'re making AI more powerful, but how can we steer towards a future where AI helps humanity flourish\\nrather than flounder? To help with this, I cofounded the Future of Life Institute. It\\'s a small nonprofit promoting\\nbeneficial technology use, and our goal is simply\\nfor the future of life to exist and to be as inspiring as possible. You know, I love technology. Technology is why today\\nis better than the Stone Age. And I\\'m optimistic that we can create\\na really inspiring high-tech future ... if -- and this is a big if -- if we win the wisdom race -- the race between the growing\\npower of our technology and the growing wisdom\\nwith which we manage it. But this is going to require\\na change of strategy because our old strategy\\nhas been learning from mistakes. We invented fire, screwed up a bunch of times -- invented the fire extinguisher. (Laughter) We invented the car,\\nscrewed up a bunch of times -- invented the traffic light,\\nthe seat belt and the airbag, but with more powerful technology\\nlike nuclear weapons and AGI, learning from mistakes\\nis a lousy strategy, don\\'t you think? (Laughter) It\\'s much better to be proactive\\nrather than reactive; plan ahead and get things\\nright the first time because that might be\\nthe only time we\\'ll get. But it is funny because\\nsometimes people tell me, \"Max, shhh, don\\'t talk like that. That\\'s Luddite scaremongering.\" But it\\'s not scaremongering. It\\'s what we at MIT\\ncall safety engineering. Think about it: before NASA launched\\nthe Apollo 11 mission, they systematically thought through\\neverything that could go wrong when you put people\\non top of explosive fuel tanks and launch them somewhere\\nwhere no one could help them. And there was a lot that could go wrong. Was that scaremongering? No. That\\'s was precisely\\nthe safety engineering that ensured the success of the mission, and that is precisely the strategy\\nI think we should take with AGI. Think through what can go wrong\\nto make sure it goes right. So in this spirit,\\nwe\\'ve organized conferences, bringing together leading\\nAI researchers and other thinkers to discuss how to grow this wisdom\\nwe need to keep AI beneficial. Our last conference\\nwas in Asilomar, California last year and produced this list of 23 principles which have since been signed\\nby over 1,000 AI researchers and key industry leaders, and I want to tell you\\nabout three of these principles. One is that we should avoid an arms race\\nand lethal autonomous weapons. The idea here is that any science\\ncan be used for new ways of helping people or new ways of harming people. For example, biology and chemistry\\nare much more likely to be used for new medicines or new cures\\nthan for new ways of killing people, because biologists\\nand chemists pushed hard -- and successfully -- for bans on biological\\nand chemical weapons. And in the same spirit, most AI researchers want to stigmatize\\nand ban lethal autonomous weapons. Another Asilomar AI principle is that we should mitigate\\nAI-fueled income inequality. I think that if we can grow\\nthe economic pie dramatically with AI and we still can\\'t figure out\\nhow to divide this pie so that everyone is better off, then shame on us. (Applause) Alright, now raise your hand\\nif your computer has ever crashed. (Laughter) Wow, that\\'s a lot of hands. Well, then you\\'ll appreciate\\nthis principle that we should invest much more\\nin AI safety research, because as we put AI in charge\\nof even more decisions and infrastructure, we need to figure out how to transform\\ntoday\\'s buggy and hackable computers into robust AI systems\\nthat we can really trust, because otherwise, all this awesome new technology\\ncan malfunction and harm us, or get hacked and be turned against us. And this AI safety work\\nhas to include work on AI value alignment, because the real threat\\nfrom AGI isn\\'t malice, like in silly Hollywood movies, but competence -- AGI accomplishing goals\\nthat just aren\\'t aligned with ours. For example, when we humans drove\\nthe West African black rhino extinct, we didn\\'t do it because we were a bunch\\nof evil rhinoceros haters, did we? We did it because\\nwe were smarter than them and our goals weren\\'t aligned with theirs. But AGI is by definition smarter than us, so to make sure that we don\\'t put\\nourselves in the position of those rhinos if we create AGI, we need to figure out how\\nto make machines understand our goals, adopt our goals and retain our goals. And whose goals should these be, anyway? Which goals should they be? This brings us to the third part\\nof our rocket metaphor: the destination. We\\'re making AI more powerful, trying to figure out how to steer it, but where do we want to go with it? This is the elephant in the room\\nthat almost nobody talks about -- not even here at TED -- because we\\'re so fixated\\non short-term AI challenges. Look, our species is trying to build AGI, motivated by curiosity and economics, but what sort of future society\\nare we hoping for if we succeed? We did an opinion poll on this recently, and I was struck to see that most people actually\\nwant us to build superintelligence: AI that\\'s vastly smarter\\nthan us in all ways. What there was the greatest agreement on\\nwas that we should be ambitious and help life spread into the cosmos, but there was much less agreement\\nabout who or what should be in charge. And I was actually quite amused to see that there\\'s some some people\\nwho want it to be just machines. (Laughter) And there was total disagreement\\nabout what the role of humans should be, even at the most basic level, so let\\'s take a closer look\\nat possible futures that we might choose\\nto steer toward, alright? So don\\'t get me wrong here. I\\'m not talking about space travel, merely about humanity\\'s\\nmetaphorical journey into the future. So one option that some\\nof my AI colleagues like is to build superintelligence\\nand keep it under human control, like an enslaved god, disconnected from the internet and used to create unimaginable\\ntechnology and wealth for whoever controls it. But Lord Acton warned us that power corrupts,\\nand absolute power corrupts absolutely, so you might worry that maybe\\nwe humans just aren\\'t smart enough, or wise enough rather, to handle this much power. Also, aside from any\\nmoral qualms you might have about enslaving superior minds, you might worry that maybe\\nthe superintelligence could outsmart us, break out and take over. But I also have colleagues\\nwho are fine with AI taking over and even causing human extinction, as long as we feel the the AIs\\nare our worthy descendants, like our children. But how would we know that the AIs\\nhave adopted our best values and aren\\'t just unconscious zombies\\ntricking us into anthropomorphizing them? Also, shouldn\\'t those people\\nwho don\\'t want human extinction have a say in the matter, too? Now, if you didn\\'t like either\\nof those two high-tech options, it\\'s important to remember\\nthat low-tech is suicide from a cosmic perspective, because if we don\\'t go far\\nbeyond today\\'s technology, the question isn\\'t whether humanity\\nis going to go extinct, merely whether\\nwe\\'re going to get taken out by the next killer asteroid, supervolcano or some other problem\\nthat better technology could have solved. So, how about having\\nour cake and eating it ... with AGI that\\'s not enslaved but treats us well because its values\\nare aligned with ours? This is the gist of what Eliezer Yudkowsky\\nhas called \"friendly AI,\" and if we can do this,\\nit could be awesome. It could not only eliminate negative\\nexperiences like disease, poverty, crime and other suffering, but it could also give us\\nthe freedom to choose from a fantastic new diversity\\nof positive experiences -- basically making us\\nthe masters of our own destiny. So in summary, our situation with technology\\nis complicated, but the big picture is rather simple. Most AI researchers\\nexpect AGI within decades, and if we just bumble\\ninto this unprepared, it will probably be\\nthe biggest mistake in human history -- let\\'s face it. It could enable brutal,\\nglobal dictatorship with unprecedented inequality,\\nsurveillance and suffering, and maybe even human extinction. But if we steer carefully, we could end up in a fantastic future\\nwhere everybody\\'s better off: the poor are richer, the rich are richer, everybody is healthy\\nand free to live out their dreams. Now, hang on. Do you folks want the future\\nthat\\'s politically right or left? Do you want the pious society\\nwith strict moral rules, or do you an hedonistic free-for-all, more like Burning Man 24/7? Do you want beautiful beaches,\\nforests and lakes, or would you prefer to rearrange\\nsome of those atoms with the computers, enabling virtual experiences? With friendly AI, we could simply\\nbuild all of these societies and give people the freedom\\nto choose which one they want to live in because we would no longer\\nbe limited by our intelligence, merely by the laws of physics. So the resources and space\\nfor this would be astronomical -- literally. So here\\'s our choice. We can either be complacent\\nabout our future, taking as an article of blind faith that any new technology\\nis guaranteed to be beneficial, and just repeat that to ourselves\\nas a mantra over and over and over again as we drift like a rudderless ship\\ntowards our own obsolescence. Or we can be ambitious -- thinking hard about how\\nto steer our technology and where we want to go with it to create the age of amazement. We\\'re all here to celebrate\\nthe age of amazement, and I feel that its essence should lie\\nin becoming not overpowered but empowered by our technology. Thank you. (Applause)', 'I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960. I\\'m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I\\'ve done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people. In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about \"the West\" and \"the Developing World.\" But the world has changed, and it\\'s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. And that\\'s what I\\'m going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course, there\\'s been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. (Laughter) So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have. And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in 2010. And what will happen in the future? Well, I\\'m going to project into 2050. I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what\\'s happening in China, and it\\'s pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did. All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent. [But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically. And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion? What about the poorest two billion here? Will they move on? Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end. Here [among the poorest], population is growing. So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we\\'ve never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening. Because we already have this [growth] in process. But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050. We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That\\'s India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families. The year is 1960. And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened? I start the world. Here we go. Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing? They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing. [When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families]. Look, Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here? They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent. That\\'s why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It\\'s only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen? Well, I\\'m not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist. I\\'m a very serious \"possibilist.\" It\\'s a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty, and global governance, the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life. This will not happen [again]. The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less. But it\\'s a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. (Applause)', 'Translator: Timothy Covell\\nReviewer: Morton Bast I\\'m going to talk about religion. But it\\'s a broad and very delicate subject, so I have to limit myself. And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality. (Laughter) This is a very serious talk. So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful. It\\'s when the young couple whisper, \"Tonight we are going to make a baby.\" My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman. This is indeed important, because everyone understands that there is some sort of limit on how many people we can be on this planet. And there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this -- three billion in 1960, seven billion just last year -- and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies, and it may continue like this. To what extent are these people right? When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world, and today, 2000, there\\'s almost two billion. What has happened since, and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century? This is a quiz. What do you think? Do you think it will decrease to one billion? Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century? Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years, or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there? I will tell you by the end of my speech. But now, what does religion have to do with it? When you want to classify religion, it\\'s more difficult than you think. You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this. It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion, but that\\'s not detailed enough. So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia, we found this map. But that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups, which was too detailed. Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map, and it looks like this. Each country\\'s a bubble. The size is the population -- big China, big India here. And the color now is the majority religion. It\\'s the religion where more than 50 percent of the people say that they belong. It\\'s Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries. Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East, Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia. That\\'s where we find Islamic majority. And Christian majority religions, we see in these countries. They are blue. And that is most countries in America and Europe, many countries in Africa and a few in Asia. The white here are countries which cannot be classified, because one religion does not reach 50 percent or there is doubt about the data or there\\'s some other reason. So we were careful with that. So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot. This is in 1960. And now I show the number of babies per woman here: two, four or six -- many babies, few babies. And here the income per person in comparable dollars. The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies. So low income here, high income there. And indeed in 1960, you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies. The exception was Japan. Japan here was regarded as an exception. Otherwise it was only Christian countries. But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman. But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa. And countries with Islam as the majority religion, all of them almost had six to seven children per woman, irregardless of the income level. And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level. Now let\\'s see what has happened in the world. I start the world, and here we go. Now 1962 -- can you see they\\'re getting a little richer, but the number of babies per woman is falling? Look at China. They\\'re falling fairly fast. And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down, as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range. And when we enter into this century, you\\'ll find more than half of mankind down here. And by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman. (Applause) It\\'s a quite amazing development which has happened. (Applause) And these are countries from United States here, with $40,000 per capita, France, Russia, Iran, Mexico, Turkey, Algeria, Indonesia, India and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam, which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States and the same amount of babies per woman. I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries. We get that from the census data. It\\'s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful. So what we can conclude is you don\\'t have to get rich to have few children. It has happened across the world. And then when we look at religions, we can see that the Eastern religions, indeed there\\'s not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children. Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity, you see countries all the way. But there\\'s no major difference. There\\'s no major difference between these religions. There is a difference with income. The countries which have many babies per woman here, they have quite low income. Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa. But there are also countries here like Guatemala, like Papua New Guinea, like Yemen and Afghanistan. Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo, which have suffered severe conflicts, that they don\\'t have fast population growth. It\\'s the other way around. In the world today, it\\'s the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth. Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child. These countries have six children per woman. They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman. But 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million. Congo will go from 60 to 120. That\\'s where we have the fast population growth. And many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not. Let me compare Senegal, a Muslim dominated country, with a Christian dominated country, Ghana. I take them backwards here to their independence, when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s. Just look what they have done. It\\'s an amazing improvement, from seven children per woman, they\\'ve gone all the way down to between four and five. It\\'s a tremendous improvement. So what does it take? Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries. You need to have children to survive. You need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family. You need to have access to some family planning. And you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor. But let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at Qatar. Here we have Qatar today, and there we have Bangladesh today. If I take these countries back to the years of their independence, which is almost the same year -- \\'71, \\'72 -- it\\'s a quite amazing development which had happened. Look at Bangladesh and Qatar. With so different incomes, it\\'s almost the same drop in number of babies per woman. And what is the reason in Qatar? Well I do as I always do. I went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage -- It\\'s a very good webpage. I recommend it -- and I looked up -- oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge, I found Qatar\\'s social trends. Very interesting. Lots to read. I found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman. These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar, and they say the most important factors are: \"Increased age at first marriage, increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force.\" I couldn\\'t agree more. Science couldn\\'t agree more. This is a country that indeed has gone through a very, very interesting modernization. So what it is, is these four: Children should survive, children shouldn\\'t be needed for work, women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible. Now look again at this. The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia -- it\\'s 2.4 today. There are countries up here which are very poor. And that\\'s where family planning, better child survival is needed. I strongly recommend Melinda Gates\\' last TEDTalk. And here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman. So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz, it\\'s two. We have reached peak child. The number of children is not growing any longer in the world. We are still debating peak oil, but we have definitely reached peak child. And the world population will stop growing. The United Nations Population Division has said it will stop growing at 10 billion. But why do they grow if the number of children doesn\\'t grow? Well I will show you here. I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came. They are quite useful for educational purposes. Each card box is one billion people. And there are two billion children in the world. There are two billion young people between 15 and 30. These are rounded numbers. Then there is one billion between 30 and 45, almost one between 45 and 60. And then it\\'s my box. This is me: 60-plus. We are here on top. So what will happen now is what we call \"the big fill-up.\" You can see that it\\'s like three billion missing here. They are not missing because they\\'ve died; they were never born. Because before 1980, there were much fewer people born than there were during the last 30 years. So what will happen now is quite straightforward. The old, sadly, we will die. The rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children. Then the old will die. The rest will grow older and get two billion children. And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children. (Applause) This is the great fill-up. It\\'s inevitable. And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children? Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman. All the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world. And we will be just 10 billion in this world, if the poorest people get out of poverty, their children survive, they get access to family planning. That is needed. But it\\'s inevitable that we will be two to three billion more. So when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future, for human beings on this planet, you have to plan for 10 billion. Thank you very much. (Applause)', 'Hans Rosling: I\\'m going to ask you three multiple choice questions. Use this device. Use this device to answer. The first question is, how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster, how did that change during the last century? Did it more than double, did it remain about the same in the world as a whole, or did it decrease to less than half? Please answer A, B or C. I see lots of answers. This is much\\nfaster than I do it at universities. They are so slow. They keep\\nthinking, thinking, thinking. Oh, very, very good. And we go to the next question. So how long did women 30 years old in the world go to school: seven years, five years or three years? A, B or C? Please answer. And we go to the next question. In the last 20 years, how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change? Extreme poverty — not having \\nenough food for the day. Did it almost double, did it remain more or less the same, or did it halve? A, B or C? Now, answers. You see, deaths from natural disasters in the world, you can see it from this graph here, from 1900 to 2000. In 1900, there was about half a million people who died every year from natural disasters: floods, earthquakes, volcanic \\neruption, whatever, droughts. And then, how did that change? Gapminder asked the public in Sweden. This is how they answered. The Swedish public answered like this: Fifty percent thought it had doubled, 38 percent said it\\'s more or less the same, 12 said it had halved. This is the best data from the disaster researchers, and it goes up and down, and it goes to the Second World War, and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling and it\\'s down to much less than half. The world has been much, much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this, you know. So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this. So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps. (Laughter) (Applause) The chimps don\\'t watch the evening news, so the chimps, they choose by random, so the\\nSwedes answer worse than random. Now how did you do? That\\'s you. You were beaten by the chimps. (Laughter) But it was close. You were three times better than the Swedes, but that\\'s not enough. You shouldn\\'t compare yourself to Swedes. You must have higher ambitions in the world. Let\\'s look at the next answer here: women in school. Here, you can see men went eight years. How long did women go to school? Well, we asked the Swedes like this, and that gives you a hint, doesn\\'t it? The right answer is probably the one the fewest Swedes picked, isn\\'t it? (Laughter) Let\\'s see, let\\'s see. Here we come. Yes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up. This is the U.S. public. And this is you. Here you come. Ooh. Well, congratulations, you\\'re\\ntwice as good as the Swedes, but you don\\'t need me — So how come? I think it\\'s like this, that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties. They are stopped when they go to school, and it\\'s disgusting. But in the majority of the world, where most people in the world live, most countries, girls today go to school as long as boys, more or less. That doesn\\'t mean that gender equity is achieved, not at all. They still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations, but schooling is there in the world today. Now, we miss the majority. When you answer, you answer\\naccording to the worst places, and there you are right, but you miss the majority. What about poverty? Well, it\\'s very clear that poverty here was almost halved, and in U.S., when we asked the public, only five percent got it right. And you? Ah, you almost made it to the chimps. (Laughter) (Applause) That little, just a few of you! There must be preconceived ideas, you know. And many in the rich countries, they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty. Of course they think so, because they don\\'t even know what has happened. The first thing to think about the future is to know about the present. These questions were a few of the first ones in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project in Gapminder Foundation that we run, and it was started, this project, last year by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter) He\\'s cofounder and director, and he wanted, Ola told me we have to be more systematic when we fight devastating ignorance. So already the pilots reveal this, that so many in the public score worse than random, so we have to think about preconceived ideas, and one of the main preconceived ideas is about world income distribution. Look here. This is how it was in 1975. It\\'s the number of people on each income, from one dollar a day — (Applause) See, there was one hump here, around one dollar a day, and then there was one hump here somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars. The world was two groups. It was a camel world, like a camel with two humps, the poor ones and the rich ones, and there were fewer in between. But look how this has changed: As I go forward, what has changed, the world population has grown, and the humps start to merge. The lower humps merged with the upper hump, and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world with one hump only. The percent in poverty has decreased. Still it\\'s appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty. We still have this group, almost a billion, over there, but that can be ended now. The challenge we have now is to get away from that,\\nunderstand where the majority is, and that is very clearly shown in this question. We asked, what is the percentage of the world\\'s one-year-old children who have got those basic vaccines against measles and other things that we have had for many years: 20, 50 or 80 percent? Now, this is what the U.S.\\npublic and the Swedish answered. Look at the Swedish result: you know what the right answer is. (Laughter) Who the heck is a professor of\\nglobal health in that country? Well, it\\'s me. It\\'s me. (Laughter) It\\'s very difficult, this. It\\'s very difficult. (Applause) However, Ola\\'s approach to really measure what we know made headlines, and CNN published these results on their web and they had the questions there, millions answered, and I think there were about 2,000 comments, and this was one of the comments. \"I bet no member of the media\\npassed the test,\" he said. So Ola told me, \"Take these devices. You are invited to media conferences. Give it to them and measure what the media know.\" And ladies and gentlemen, for the first time, the informal results from a conference with U.S. media. And then, lately, from the European Union media. (Laughter) You see, the problem is not that people don\\'t read and listen to the media. The problem is that the\\nmedia doesn\\'t know themselves. What shall we do about this, Ola? Do we have any ideas? (Applause) Ola Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first, I\\'m so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps. Fortunately, I will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault, actually. Then, I will equip you with some tricks for beating the chimps in the future. That\\'s basically what I will do. But first, let\\'s look at why are we so ignorant, and it all starts in this place. It\\'s Hudiksvall. It\\'s a city in northern Sweden. It\\'s a neighborhood where I grew up, and it\\'s a neighborhood with a large problem. Actually, it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods where you grew up as well. It was not representative. Okay? It gave me a very biased view of how life is on this planet. So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle. We have a personal bias. We have all different experiences from communities and people we meet, and on top of this, we start school, and we add the next problem. Well, I like schools, but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews, because they learned something\\nwhen they went to school, and now they describe this world to the students without any bad intentions, and those books, of course, that are printed are outdated in a world that changes. And there is really no practice to keep the teaching material up to date. So that\\'s what we are focusing on. So we have these outdated facts added on top of our personal bias. What happens next is news, okay? An excellent journalist knows how to pick the story that will make headlines, and people will read it because it\\'s sensational. Unusual events are more interesting, no? And they are exaggerated, and especially things we\\'re afraid of. A shark attack on a Swedish person will get headlines for weeks in Sweden. So these three skewed sources of information were really hard to get away from. They kind of bombard us and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas, and on top of it we put the very thing that makes us humans, our human intuition. It was good in evolution. It helped us generalize and jump to conclusions very, very fast. It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of, and we seek causality where there is none, and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers, above the average. Everybody answered that question, \"Yeah, I drive cars better.\" Okay, this was good evolutionarily, but now when it comes to the worldview, it is the exact reason why it\\'s upside down. The trends that are increasing are instead falling, and the other way around, and in this case, the chimps\\nuse our intuition against us, and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength. It was supposed to be our strength, wasn\\'t it? So how do we solve such problems? First, we need to measure it, and then we need to cure it. So by measuring it we can understand what is the pattern of ignorance. We started the pilot last year, and now we\\'re pretty sure that we will encounter a lot of ignorance across the whole world, and the idea is really to scale it up to all domains or dimensions of global development, such as climate, endangered species, human rights, gender equality, energy, finance. All different sectors have facts, and there are organizations trying to spread awareness about these facts. So I\\'ve started actually contacting some of them, like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF, and asking them, what are your favorite facts which you think the public doesn\\'t know? Okay, I gather those facts. Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts. And then we poll the public and see where they score worst. So we get a shorter list with the terrible results, like some few examples from Hans, and we have no problem finding these kinds of terrible results. Okay, this little shortlist, what\\nare we going to do with it? Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate, a global knowledge certificate, which you can use, if you\\'re a large organization, a school, a university, or maybe a news agency, to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable. Basically meaning, we don\\'t hire people who score like chimpanzees. Of course you shouldn\\'t. So maybe 10 years from now, if this project succeeds, you will be sitting in an interview having to fill out this crazy global knowledge. So now we come to the practical tricks. How are you going to succeed? There is, of course, one way, which is to sit down late nights and learn all the facts by heart by reading all these reports. That will never happen, actually. Not even Hans thinks that\\'s going to happen. People don\\'t have that time. People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts. We need to turn our intuition into strength again. We need to be able to generalize. So now I\\'m going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around into rules of thumb. Let\\'s start with the first misconception. This is very widespread. Everything is getting worse. You heard it. You thought it yourself. The other way to think is, most things improve. So you\\'re sitting with a question in front of you and you\\'re unsure. You should guess \"improve.\" Okay? Don\\'t go for the worse. That will help you score better on our tests. (Applause) That was the first one. There are rich and poor and the gap is increasing. It\\'s a terrible inequality. Yeah, it\\'s an unequal world, but when you look at the data, it\\'s one hump. Okay? If you feel unsure, go for \"the most people are in the middle.\" That\\'s going to help you get the answer right. Now, the next preconceived idea is first countries and people need to be very, very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters. No, no, no. That\\'s wrong. Look: that huge hump in the middle already have girls in school. So if you are unsure, go for the \"the majority already have this,\" like electricity and girls in\\nschool, these kinds of things. They\\'re only rules of thumb, so of course they don\\'t apply to everything, but this is how you can generalize. Let\\'s look at the last one. If something, yes, this is a good one, sharks are dangerous. No — well, yes, but they are not so important in the global statistics, that is what I\\'m saying. I actually, I\\'m very afraid of sharks. So as soon as I see a question\\nabout things I\\'m afraid of, which might be earthquakes, other religions, maybe I\\'m afraid of terrorists or sharks, anything that makes me feel, assume you\\'re going to exaggerate the problem. That\\'s a rule of thumb. Of course there are dangerous \\nthings that are also great. Sharks kill very, very few.\\nThat\\'s how you should think. With these four rules of thumb, you could probably answer better than the chimps, because the chimps cannot do this. They cannot generalize these kinds of rules. And hopefully we can turn your world around and we\\'re going to beat the chimps. Okay? (Applause) That\\'s a systematic approach. Now the question, is this important? Yeah, it\\'s important to understand poverty, extreme poverty and how to fight it, and how to bring girls in school. When we realize that actually it\\'s\\nsucceeding, we can understand it. But is it important for everyone else who cares about the rich end of this scale? I would say yes, extremely important, for the same reason. If you have a fact-based worldview of today, you might have a chance to understand what\\'s coming next in the future. We\\'re going back to these two humps in 1975. That\\'s when I was born, and I selected the West. That\\'s the current EU countries and North America. Let\\'s now see how the rest and the West compares in terms of how rich you are. These are the people who can afford to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation. In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived outside EU and North America. But this has changed, okay? So first, let\\'s look at the change up till today, 2014. Today it\\'s 50/50. The Western domination is over, as of today. That\\'s nice. So what\\'s going to happen next? Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved? I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF,\\nInternational Monetary Fund, website. They have a forecast for the next \\nfive years of GDP per capita. So I can use that to go five years into the future, assuming the income inequality \\nof each country is the same. I did that, but I went even further. I used those five years for the next 20 years with the same speed, just as an \\nexperiment what might actually happen. Let\\'s move into the future. In 2020, it\\'s 57 percent in the rest. In 2025, 63 percent. 2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is \\noutnumbered in the rich consumer market. These are just projections of \\nGDP per capita into the future. Seventy-three percent of the rich consumers are going to live outside North America and Europe. So yes, I think it\\'s a good idea for \\na company to use this certificate to make sure to make fact-\\nbased decisions in the future. Thank you very much. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Hans and Ola Rosling!', 'I\\'m going to talk about\\nhow AI and mankind can coexist, but first, we have to rethink\\nabout our human values. So let me first make a confession\\nabout my errors in my values. It was 11 o\\'clock, December 16, 1991. I was about to become a father\\nfor the first time. My wife, Shen-Ling,\\nlay in the hospital bed going through a very difficult\\n12-hour labor. I sat by her bedside but looked anxiously at my watch, and I knew something that she didn\\'t. I knew that if in one hour, our child didn\\'t come, I was going to leave her there and go back to work and make a presentation about AI to my boss, Apple\\'s CEO. Fortunately, my daughter\\nwas born at 11:30 -- (Laughter) (Applause) sparing me from doing the unthinkable, and to this day, I am so sorry for letting my work ethic\\ntake precedence over love for my family. (Applause) My AI talk, however, went off brilliantly. (Laughter) Apple loved my work\\nand decided to announce it at TED1992, 26 years ago on this very stage. I thought I had made one of the biggest,\\nmost important discoveries in AI, and so did the \"Wall Street Journal\"\\non the following day. But as far as discoveries went, it turned out, I didn\\'t discover India, or America. Perhaps I discovered\\na little island off of Portugal. But the AI era of discovery continued, and more scientists\\npoured their souls into it. About 10 years ago, the grand AI discovery was made by three\\nNorth American scientists, and it\\'s known as deep learning. Deep learning is a technology\\nthat can take a huge amount of data within one single domain and learn to predict or decide\\nat superhuman accuracy. For example, if we show\\nthe deep learning network a massive number of food photos, it can recognize food such as hot dog or no hot dog. (Applause) Or if we show it many pictures\\nand videos and sensor data from driving on the highway, it can actually drive a car\\nas well as a human being on the highway. And what if we showed\\nthis deep learning network all the speeches made by President Trump? Then this artificially\\nintelligent President Trump, actually the network -- (Laughter) can -- (Applause) You like double oxymorons, huh? (Laughter) (Applause) So this network, if given the request\\nto make a speech about AI, he, or it, might say -- (Recording) Donald Trump:\\nIt\\'s a great thing to build a better world\\nwith artificial intelligence. Kai-Fu Lee: And maybe in another language? DT: (Speaking Chinese) (Laughter) KFL: You didn\\'t know\\nhe knew Chinese, did you? So deep learning has become the core\\nin the era of AI discovery, and that\\'s led by the US. But we\\'re now in the era\\nof implementation, where what really matters is execution,\\nproduct quality, speed and data. And that\\'s where China comes in. Chinese entrepreneurs, who I fund as a venture capitalist, are incredible workers, amazing work ethic. My example in the delivery room is nothing\\ncompared to how hard people work in China. As an example, one startup\\ntried to claim work-life balance: \"Come work for us because we are 996.\" And what does that mean? It means the work hours\\nof 9am to 9pm, six days a week. That\\'s contrasted\\nwith other startups that do 997. And the Chinese product quality\\nhas consistently gone up in the past decade, and that\\'s because of\\na fiercely competitive environment. In Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs\\ncompete in a very gentlemanly fashion, sort of like in old wars\\nin which each side took turns to fire at each other. (Laughter) But in the Chinese environment, it\\'s truly a gladiatorial\\nfight to the death. In such a brutal environment,\\nentrepreneurs learn to grow very rapidly, they learn to make their products\\nbetter at lightning speed, and they learn\\nto hone their business models until they\\'re impregnable. As a result, great Chinese products\\nlike WeChat and Weibo are arguably better than the equivalent American products\\nfrom Facebook and Twitter. And the Chinese market\\nembraces this change and accelerated change\\nand paradigm shifts. As an example, if any of you go to China, you will see it\\'s almost cashless\\nand credit card-less, because that thing that we all\\ntalk about, mobile payment, has become the reality in China. In the last year, 18.8 trillion US dollars\\nwere transacted on mobile internet, and that\\'s because\\nof very robust technologies built behind it. It\\'s even bigger than the China GDP. And this technology, you can say,\\nhow can it be bigger than the GDP? Because it includes all transactions: wholesale, channels,\\nretail, online, offline, going into a shopping mall\\nor going into a farmers market like this. The technology is used\\nby 700 million people to pay each other, not just merchants, so it\\'s peer to peer, and it\\'s almost transaction-fee-free. And it\\'s instantaneous, and it\\'s used everywhere. And finally, the China market is enormous. This market is large, which helps give entrepreneurs\\nmore users, more revenue, more investment, but most importantly, it gives the entrepreneurs a chance\\nto collect a huge amount of data which becomes rocket fuel\\nfor the AI engine. So as a result, the Chinese AI companies have leaped ahead so that today, the most valuable companies in computer vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis,\\nmachine translation and drones are all Chinese companies. So with the US leading\\nthe era of discovery and China leading\\nthe era of implementation, we are now in an amazing age where the dual engine\\nof the two superpowers are working together to drive the fastest\\nrevolution in technology that we have ever seen as humans. And this will bring tremendous wealth, unprecedented wealth: 16 trillion dollars, according to PwC, in terms of added GDP\\nto the worldwide GDP by 2030. It will also bring immense challenges in terms of potential job replacements. Whereas in the Industrial Age it created more jobs because craftsman jobs were being\\ndecomposed into jobs in the assembly line, so more jobs were created. But AI completely replaces\\nthe individual jobs in the assembly line with robots. And it\\'s not just in factories, but truckers, drivers and even jobs like telesales,\\ncustomer service and hematologists as well as radiologists over the next 15 years are going to be gradually replaced by artificial intelligence. And only the creative jobs -- (Laughter) I have to make myself safe, right? Really, the creative jobs\\nare the ones that are protected, because AI can optimize but not create. But what\\'s more serious\\nthan the loss of jobs is the loss of meaning, because the work ethic\\nin the Industrial Age has brainwashed us into thinking\\nthat work is the reason we exist, that work defined\\nthe meaning of our lives. And I was a prime and willing victim\\nto that type of workaholic thinking. I worked incredibly hard. That\\'s why I almost left\\nmy wife in the delivery room, that\\'s why I worked 996\\nalongside my entrepreneurs. And that obsession that I had with work ended abruptly a few years ago when I was diagnosed\\nwith fourth stage lymphoma. The PET scan here shows\\nover 20 malignant tumors jumping out like fireballs, melting away my ambition. But more importantly, it helped me reexamine my life. Knowing that I may only have\\na few months to live caused me to see how foolish it was for me to base my entire self-worth on how hard I worked\\nand the accomplishments from hard work. My priorities were\\ncompletely out of order. I neglected my family. My father had passed away, and I never had a chance\\nto tell him I loved him. My mother had dementia\\nand no longer recognized me, and my children had grown up. During my chemotherapy, I read a book by Bronnie Ware who talked about dying wishes and regrets\\nof the people in the deathbed. She found that facing death, nobody regretted that they didn\\'t\\nwork hard enough in this life. They only regretted that they didn\\'t\\nspend enough time with their loved ones and that they didn\\'t spread their love. So I am fortunately today in remission. (Applause) So I can be back at TED again to share with you\\nthat I have changed my ways. I now only work 965 -- occasionally 996, but usually 965. I moved closer to my mother, my wife usually travels with me, and when my kids have vacation,\\nif they don\\'t come home, I go to them. So it\\'s a new form of life that helped me recognize how important it is that love is for me, and facing death\\nhelped me change my life, but it also helped me see a new way of how AI should impact mankind and work and coexist with mankind, that really, AI is taking away\\na lot of routine jobs, but routine jobs are not what we\\'re about. Why we exist is love. When we hold our newborn baby, love at first sight, or when we help someone in need, humans are uniquely able\\nto give and receive love, and that\\'s what differentiates us from AI. Despite what science fiction may portray, I can responsibly tell you\\nthat AI has no love. When AlphaGo defeated\\nthe world champion Ke Jie, while Ke Jie was crying\\nand loving the game of go, AlphaGo felt no happiness from winning and certainly no desire\\nto hug a loved one. So how do we differentiate ourselves as humans in the age of AI? We talked about the axis of creativity, and certainly that is one possibility, and now we introduce a new axis that we can call compassion,\\nlove, or empathy. Those are things that AI cannot do. So as AI takes away the routine jobs, I like to think we can, we should\\nand we must create jobs of compassion. You might ask how many of those there are, but I would ask you: Do you not think that we are going\\nto need a lot of social workers to help us make this transition? Do you not think we need\\na lot of compassionate caregivers to give more medical care to more people? Do you not think we\\'re going to need\\n10 times more teachers to help our children find their way to survive and thrive\\nin this brave new world? And with all the newfound wealth, should we not also make\\nlabors of love into careers and let elderly accompaniment or homeschooling become careers also? (Applause) This graph is surely not perfect, but it points at four ways\\nthat we can work with AI. AI will come and take away\\nthe routine jobs and in due time, we will be thankful. AI will become great tools\\nfor the creatives so that scientists, artists,\\nmusicians and writers can be even more creative. AI will work with humans\\nas analytical tools that humans can wrap their warmth around for the high-compassion jobs. And we can always differentiate ourselves with the uniquely capable jobs that are both compassionate and creative, using and leveraging\\nour irreplaceable brains and hearts. So there you have it: a blueprint of coexistence\\nfor humans and AI. AI is serendipity. It is here to liberate us\\nfrom routine jobs, and it is here to remind us\\nwhat it is that makes us human. So let us choose to embrace AI\\nand to love one another. Thank you. (Applause)', 'I am proudly named Alicia\\nafter my grandma.

Only that didn\\'t happen, because her mom, a 44-year-old physician, had suddenly passed away from a stroke. Unfortunately, our stories are common. Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death\\nand disability worldwide. And for women, it is not only harder to recognize,\\ndiagnose and treat, but after a heart attack or a stroke,\\nwomen also face higher mortality. There are about 44 million women\\nliving in the US with heart disease, and the incidences for women\\nunder 65 are on the rise. So what\\'s going on? The answer lies at the intersection\\nof two areas: data and medical devices. Let\\'s look at data first, or the lack of it. When I was doing\\ncardiovascular research at MIT, I had access to huge data sets. Realizing that women were one\\nof the largest subgroups underrepresented was eye-opening. In fact, women were basically excluded\\nfrom cardiovascular clinical trials until the NIH mandated inclusion in 1993. This is why existing technologies\\nand therapies often fall short, because most of them have been designed using data primarily\\nfrom male animals and men. And as artificial intelligence\\nhelps turbocharge digital health, there\\'s a danger that algorithms\\nmostly trained with male data and biases will actually perpetuate the problem. Next, let\\'s look at medical devices. The \"one type fits all\" approach doesn\\'t even take into account the fact\\nthat heart disease and stroke can present differently in women. Way too often, female thresholds\\nare not programmed. Smaller arteries cannot be visualized, and poor clinical-grade monitoring systems cannot accommodate\\ntwo different body shapes or stages in life. In the 1800s, Amelia Bloomer\\nled a movement against damaging corsets, towards more comfortable\\nand useful garments for women. She inspired us to think: What if we could solve both the data\\nand the device challenge by using a garment\\nthat most women already wear daily? What if a garment\\ndesigned to support women could also augment their health? Our idea is to turn the everyday bra\\ninto an actual lifesaver. And this is how we\\'re doing it. This is our augmented garment platform. It gives women the ability to continuously and remotely\\nacquire physiological data. By wearing these bras, women can view insights and patterns and keep an automated\\njournal in their phones, giving them a simple way to tag symptoms and collect life-saving data\\nto share with their doctors for early detection\\nand targeted management. It can even track the safety\\nand efficacy of certain therapies. We\\'ve built medical-grade textile sensors that can adapt to multiple\\nbra styles and sizes for continuous, reliable\\nand repeatable data, all around her torso and her heart. We can track heart rhythm, breathing,\\ntemperature, posture and movement, and by applying algorithms,\\nwe can use this data to decode symptoms, articulate arrhythmia triggers and generate personalized\\ndigital biomarkers. Unlike traditional biomarkers, like blood,\\nthat take a snapshot in time, digital biomarkers work more like a video, using data collected over time\\nto explain, influence and even predict health outcomes. They have the potential\\nto enable care immediately. No more wait time for results. She has the data available\\nwhen she needs it the most. With medical-grade technology\\nas easy as wearing a bra, we could catch up, close the data gap, enable easier participation\\nin clinical trials and bring women\\'s health care\\ninto the 21st century. The more women that wear\\nthese augmented bras, the faster we can create\\na truly meaningful and inclusive data set on women\\'s health. Collectively, this data\\ncan enable breakthroughs in digital diagnostics and therapeutics to solve some of the biggest\\nhealth-care challenges humanity faces today. With our unique biological data, our ability to gather more and more of it and our ability to learn from it using AI, the dream of making medicine\\nwithout bias and truly personal can be achieved. And that, of course, benefits all of us. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)', 'I\\'d like to talk to you today about the human brain, which is what we do research on at the University of California. Just think about this problem for a second. Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds, which you can hold in the palm of your hand. But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity, ask questions about the meaning of its own existence, about the nature of God. And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world. It\\'s the greatest mystery confronting human beings: How does this all come about? Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons. We\\'re looking at neurons here. There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain. And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain. And based on this, people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe. So, how do you go about studying the brain? One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior. This is what I spoke about in the last TED. Today I\\'ll talk about a different approach, which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain, and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain. Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain. Now, one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy, in Parma, by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues, is a group of neurons called mirror neurons, which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes. Now, it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain, which have been known for over 50 years. These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action. For example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple, a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire. If I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire, commanding me to pull that object. These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time. But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons, maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire when I\\'m looking at somebody else performing the same action. So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something, but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something. And this is truly astonishing. Because it\\'s as though this neuron is adopting the other person\\'s point of view. It\\'s almost as though it\\'s performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person\\'s action. Now, what is the significance of these mirror neurons? For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation. Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person\\'s point of view. So, this is important for imitation and emulation. Well, why is that important? Well, let\\'s take a look at the next slide. So, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important? Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation. Now, let\\'s look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture. If you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago, let\\'s look at human evolution, it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago. And that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use, the use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language, and the ability to read somebody else\\'s mind and interpret that person\\'s behavior. All of that happened relatively quickly. Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago, 100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly. And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system, which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people\\'s actions. So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group, say the use of fire, or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out, this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population, or was transmitted vertically, down the generations. So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian. Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years. A polar bear, to evolve a coat, will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years. A human being, a child, can just watch its parent kill another polar bear, and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body, and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn, it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes. And then once it\\'s learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population. This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization. Now there is another kind of mirror neuron, which is involved in something quite different. And that is, there are mirror neurons, just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch. In other words, if somebody touches me, my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires. But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire when I simply watch another person being touched. So, it\\'s empathizing the other person being touched. So, most of them will fire when I\\'m touched in different locations. Different neurons for different locations. But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location. So, here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy. Now, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched, why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched? I mean, I empathize with that person but I don\\'t literally feel the touch. Well, that\\'s because you\\'ve got receptors in your skin, touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain and saying \"Don\\'t worry, you\\'re not being touched. So, empathize, by all means, with the other person, but do not actually experience the touch, otherwise you\\'ll get confused and muddled.\" Okay, so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch. But if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm, so you put an injection into my arm, anesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb, and there is no sensations coming in, if I now watch you being touched, I literally feel it in my hand. In other words, you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. So, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons. (Laughter) And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense. All that\\'s separating you from him, from the other person, is your skin. Remove the skin, you experience that person\\'s touch in your mind. You\\'ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. And this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy, and that is there is no real independent self, aloof from other human beings, inspecting the world, inspecting other people. You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet, you\\'re actually quite literally connected by your neurons. And there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other. And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else\\'s consciousness. And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy. It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience. So, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else being touched, you feel it in your phantom. Now the astonishing thing is, if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person\\'s hand, massage the other person\\'s hand, that relieves the pain in your phantom hand, almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged. So, here you have my last slide. For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct. C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures: science on the one hand, humanities on the other; never the twain shall meet. So, I\\'m saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness, representation of self, what separates you from other human beings, what allows you to empathize with other human beings, and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization, which is unique to human beings. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Chris Anderson: A year go at global\\nCountdown\\'s virtual launch, Monica Araya, who,\\namong many other things, is a distinguished fellow\\nat the ClimateWorks Foundation, she shared news of a campaign to take on the massive emissions from the world\\'s cars,\\ntrucks and buses, etc. And we have an exciting update\\nthat we want to share with you. Monica, welcome here\\nto the Countdown stage. Monica Araya: Thank you. It\\'s so great to be here,\\nand so great to see you in person. (Applause) CA: So look, you\\'re up\\nagainst a vast industry. I mean, there are more than a billion\\npolluting vehicles out there. How on Earth can you attempt\\nsystem change at that scale? MA: Well, that is the point that,\\nbecause of the scale and because of the speed that we need to inject\\ninto this transformation, we have to work with all the levers\\nof change simultaneously. That\\'s the key point. So, cities, we have to engage with cities. That\\'s great. Not enough. We have to engage with politicians. We have to engage\\nwith the companies themselves. We have to create business coalitions. And we also have to empower citizens\\nso that they play their act. Ultimately, we know\\nthat we have to create political space for stricter regulations for policy. So that is something\\nwe are doing right now. CA: In a sense, these\\naren\\'t separate initiatives. They all build on each other? MA: Exactly. So think about an automaker. Maybe we have some in the room. So you\\'re not going to give up\\nyour profits just like this. But. If you hear that so many\\ncities start saying no more petrol and diesel cars\\nare going to circulate in our streets; and you hear the politicians saying that life is going to get\\nmore difficult for fossil fuels; and you turn on the TV\\nand you see millions of people saying, you know, we’re angry\\nabout the products that you’re making; and you look at the demand and you look at companies that are saying, \"You know what? We\\'re switching. It\\'s working. We\\'re saving money.\" Then you have to act. CA: But how could you take on\\nall these agendas at once? MA: That\\'s the point. You can\\'t do just one thing, or you can\\'t just expect\\none single organization to do this. So this is the exciting news. A group of over 70 -- seven, zero --\\norganizations are coming together, creating a coalition, a global campaign, we call it Drive Electric,\\nand it\\'s already shaking things up. CA: How so? MA: Well, the best thing would be\\nto give you one example from this year. So partners of this coalition have done an amazing job\\npersuading the European Commission to propose that after 2035, there will be no more sales\\nof petrol and diesel cars. And this alone was\\nunthinkable two years ago. And even though I mentioned in Europe, the progress is happening from China\\nto California, everything in between, including the small countries. CA: So Monica, what’s the overall goal\\nof the Drive Electric campaign? MA: Well, we have to persuade the world\\nto do exactly what I just mentioned, and actually in some cities\\nand some countries, you can actually go faster. And the point is that we need\\nto set these timelines, make it normal, you know. Say, after this year, say, 2035, we\\'re not going to sell\\nmore petrol and diesel cars. And now our campaign works\\nwith all segments. So we say, buses 2030, trucks 2040. And if we want to get there, if we say we have to be here by 2035, then the next five years are so critical. So that is what we have to achieve. You know, we have to get\\nto these mark and tipping point. CA: But just to play\\ndevil\\'s advocate there. MA: I know you like to do that. CA: Well, you know.\\nMA: It\\'s OK. CA: Wouldn\\'t some people say that actually were kind of already\\nat that tipping point? And that in a sense, the move to electrification\\nis already inevitable? MA: Thank you, because that\\'s a very important question. You know, it reflects\\nthat we\\'re making progress, and that\\'s a good thing. So somebody could say, well, you know, let\\'s take Tesla, you know,\\nsuper pioneering, deserves a lot of credit. And yet if we look at our partners, early on, they advocated the very policies to promote early adoption\\nof electric vehicles. So timing is everything. We cannot waste any time. So if you look at the progress\\nwe’re making, yes, it’s there, and yet, only one percent\\nof the global stock of cars and trucks is electric right now. So we have to keep that in mind\\nand also, you know, coming from a developing country myself,\\nCosta Rica, as you know, I would not say that in the global South,\\nthis is already inevitable. In fact, when you look\\nat some industry projections, you still find that at least\\nsome companies see a lot of fossil fuel cars\\nin their future up to 2050. CA: OK, so if that\\'s still happening\\nin 2050, we\\'re screwed. So the goal of the campaign is basically\\nto accelerate that by how much? MA: So here\\'s the point. The campaign in the next year is going to accelerate this 20 years, Twenty years, make it happen faster. And we calculate that -- I know you like the numbers -- (CA laughs) So we calculate that doing that faster\\nwill save the planet 160 gigatons of CO2 equivalent. CA: Wow. 160 billion tons of CO2. On my maths, that\\'s more than three years\\' worth\\nof humanity\\'s entire emissions, excess emissions. So that\\'s a huge, huge number. But, look, you\\'re up against industries that are, you know, getting trillions of dollars\\nof revenue annually. How can your coalition\\npossibly take that on? MA: Well, there is opposition,\\nand the more progress we make, the more the opposition gets activated. So that\\'s why we\\'re saying Drive Electric\\nis the most ambitious coalition and campaign in our space ever undertaken. And what we need to make sure\\nis that we grow it, we grow the partners and we secure\\nfunding for what they do because they are playing a key role in their geographies,\\nplaying all these levers. So we have to make sure they get\\nthe resources to work on the ground. CA: So you’re raising money,\\nnot just for ClimateWorks but for all of these partners. MA: Yes. CA: How much is it going to take? MA: For the next five years,\\nroughly one billion dollars. CA: I mean, Monica, as you know, when I when first heard that number, I said, “No way.” I mean, you\\'re looking for this\\nfrom philanthropists. There\\'s no precedent for that. And yet this is kind of where\\nthe exciting news comes in, because ... Drive Electric and TED and Countdown and a coalition of visionary donors\\ncalled the Audacious Project have been working together on this, and just a few weeks ago,\\nsomething kind of amazing happened. We were able to secure a commitment\\nfrom them for how much? MA: 300 million dollars. (Applause) CA: This was really exciting, and it builds on a couple hundred million already committed by the founding\\ndonors of Drive Electric, so that we\\'re already over halfway\\nto your billion-dollar goal, right? So how is this? How does this feel? Where are you now? MA: It\\'s electrifying. (Laughter) But I mean, I know\\nthere partners are here, I can see where they are sitting, from foundations, I’m sure Anthony’s somewhere here. We are so excited\\nbecause we have come to a point where we know this campaign\\nis unstoppable. And in short, you know, we are going to make sure\\nthat all of this gets translated into all these strategies\\nthat we have to deploy in the key geographies. And, think about the fact\\nthat this is happening just as we move to COP. So that is also very good news. CA: And everyone in this room\\ncan actually play a part. Or indeed, if you\\'re watching online. If you live in a city, please advocate to create\\nand expand a green zone where only electric vehicles are welcome. If you work in government, raise your level of ambition. Ignore the fossilized lobbyists. This is a winning political issue for you. MA: If you are a citizen, consider not buying\\nan internal-combustion car. And why not share it? Share it with friends, share it in your social media. If you are a creative, if you are an influencer,\\nif you\\'re an artist, help us. We need to find new and better ways\\nof telling the story. CA: And finally, if you work for a company that makes or uses cars, trucks, motorized vehicles of any kind, do what you can to urge them\\nto get on the right side of history. I mean, Monica, what do you think,\\ncan we actually do this? MA: Yes, we have to work\\ntogether, go faster. And let me finish by saying this. This campaign is about\\nchanging transportation, with all the benefits that that brings\\nto people and the planet. And yet, it is also about showing how\\nsystems change works in practice and making sure it happens\\neverywhere else. So let\\'s do it. CA: Thank you, Monica. Thank you, everyone. (Applause)', 'How do we build a society without fossil fuels? This is a very complex challenge, and I believe developing countries\\ncould take the lead in this transition. And I\\'m aware that this\\nis a contentious statement, but the reality is that so much\\nis at stake in our countries if we let fossil fuels stay\\nat the center of our development. We can do it differently. And it\\'s time, it really is time, to debunk the myth that a country has to choose\\nbetween development on the one hand and environmental protection,\\nrenewables, quality of life, on the other. I come from Costa Rica,\\na developing country. We are nearly five million people, and we live right in the middle\\nof the Americas, so it\\'s very easy\\nto remember where we live. Nearly 100 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources, five of them. (Applause) Hydropower, geothermal, wind, solar, biomass. Did you know that last year, for 299 days, we did not use any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity? It\\'s a fantastic achievement, and yet, it hides a paradox, which is that nearly 70 percent of all our energy consumption is oil. Why? Because of our transportation system, which is totally dependent\\non fossil fuels, like it is in most countries. So if we think of the energy\\ntransition as a marathon, the question is, how do we get\\nto the finish line, how do we decarbonize\\nthe rest of the economy? And it\\'s fair to say\\nthat if we don\\'t succeed, it\\'s difficult to see who will. So that is why I want\\nto talk to you about Costa Rica, because I believe we are a great candidate in pioneering a vision\\nfor development without fossil fuels. If you know one thing about our country, it\\'s that we don\\'t have an army. So I\\'m going to take you back to 1948. That year, the country\\nwas coming out of civil war. Thousands of Costa Ricans had died, and families were bitterly split. And yet, a surprising idea\\nwon the hearts and minds: we would reboot the country, and that Second Republic\\nwould have no army. So we abolished it. And the president at the time, José Figueres, found a powerful way\\nby smashing the walls of an army base. The following year, 1949, we made that decision permanent\\nin the new constitution, and that is why I can tell you that story\\nnearly 70 years later. And I\\'m grateful. I\\'m grateful they made that decision\\nbefore I was born, because it allowed me\\nand millions of others to live in a very stable country. And you might be thinking\\nthat it was good luck, but it wasn\\'t. There was a pattern of deliberate choices. In the \\'40s, Costa Ricans were given\\nfree education and free health care. We called that social guarantees. By abolishing the army, we were able to turn military spending\\ninto social spending, and that was a driver of stability. In the \\'50s -- (Applause) In the \\'50s, we started\\ninvesting in hydropower, and that kept us away from the trap of using fossil fuels\\nfor electricity generation, which is what the world\\nis struggling with today. In the \\'70s we invested in national parks, and that kept us away from the deeply flawed logic\\nof growth, growth, growth at any cost that you see others embracing,\\nespecially in the developing world. In the \\'90s, we pioneered payments\\nfor ecosystem services, and that helped us reverse deforestation and boosted ecotourism,\\nwhich today is a key engine of growth. So investing in environmental protection did not hurt our economy. Quite the opposite. And it doesn\\'t mean we are perfect, and it doesn\\'t mean\\nwe don\\'t have contradictions. That\\'s not the point. The point is that,\\nby making our own choices, we were able to develop resilience\\nin dealing with development problems. Also, if you take a country like ours, the GDP per capita\\nis around 11,000 dollars, depending on how you measure it. But according to\\nthe Social Progress Index, we are an absolute outlier when it comes to turning GDP\\ninto social progress. Abolishing the army, investing in nature and people, did something very powerful, too. It shaped the narrative, the narrative of a small country\\nwith big ideas, and it was very empowering\\nto grow up with that narrative. So the question is, what is the next big idea\\nfor this generation? And I believe what comes next is for this generation\\nto let go of fossil fuels for good, just as we did with the army. Fossil fuels create climate change. We know that, and we know how vulnerable we are\\nto the impacts of climate change. So as a developing country,\\nit is in our best interest to build development without fossil fuels that harm people in the first place. Because why would we continue importing oil for transportation if we can use electricity instead? Remember, this is the country where electricity\\ncomes from water in our rivers, heat from volcanoes, wind turbines, solar panels, biowaste. Abolishing fossil fuels means\\ndisrupting our transportation system so that we can power our cars,\\nbuses and trains with electricity instead of dirty energy. And transportation, let me tell you, has become an existential issue\\nfor us Costa Ricans, because the model we have\\nis not working for us. It\\'s hurting people, it\\'s hurting companies, and it\\'s hurting our health. Because when policies\\nand infrastructure fail, this is what happens on a daily basis. Two hours in the morning, two hours in the evening. I don\\'t understand why\\nwe have to accept this as normal. It\\'s offensive to have to waste our time like this\\nevery single day. And this highway is actually quite good compared to what you see\\nin other countries where traffic is exploding. You know, Costa Ricans call this \"presa.\" Presa means \"imprisoned.\" And people are turning violent in a country that is otherwise\\nhappy in pura vida. It\\'s happening. So a lot is at stake. The good news is that when we talk\\nabout clean transportation and different mobility, we\\'re not talking about\\nsome distant utopia out there. We\\'re talking about electric mobility\\nthat is happening today. By 2022, electric cars\\nand conventional cars are expected to cost the same, and cities are already trying\\nelectric buses. And these really cool creatures are saving money, and they reduce pollution. So if we want to get rid\\nof oil-based transportation, we can, because we have options now\\nthat we didn\\'t have before. It\\'s really exciting. But of course, some get very uncomfortable\\nwith this idea, and they will come and they will tell you that the world is stuck with oil,\\nand so is Costa Rica, so get real. That\\'s what they tell you. And you know what the answer\\nto that argument is? That in 1948, we didn\\'t say\\nthe world is stuck with armies, so let\\'s keep our army, too. No, we made a very brave choice, and that choice made the whole difference. So it\\'s time for this generation\\nto be brave again and abolish fossil fuels for good. And I\\'ll give you three reasons\\nwhy we have to do this. First, our model of transportation\\nand urbanization is broken, so this is the best moment\\nto redefine our urban and mobility future. We don\\'t want cities\\nthat are built for cars. We want cities for people where we can walk and we can use bikes. And we want public transportation, lots of it, public transportation\\nthat is clean and dignifying. Because if we continue\\nadding fleets of conventional cars, our cities will become unbearable. Second, we have to change, but incremental change\\nis not going to be sufficient. We need transformational change. And there are some\\nincremental projects in my country, and I am the first one to celebrate them. But let\\'s not kid ourselves. We\\'re not talking about ending up\\nwith really beautiful electric cars here and a few electric buses there while we keep investing\\nin the same kind of infrastructure, more cars, more roads, more oil. We\\'re talking about\\nbreaking free from oil, and you cannot get there\\nthrough incrementalism. Third, and you know this one, the world is hungry for inspiration. It craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues, especially in developing countries. So I believe Costa Rica\\ncan be an inspiration to others, as we did last year when we disclosed that for so many days\\nwe were not using any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity. The news went viral around the world. Also, and this makes me extremely proud, a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres, played a decisive role in the negotiations\\nof the Paris climate agreement. So we have to protect that legacy\\nand be an example. So what comes next? The people. How do we get people to own this? How do we get people to believe that it\\'s possible to build a society without fossil fuels? A lot of work from\\nthe ground up is needed. That is why, in 2014,\\nwe created Costa Rica Limpia. \"Limpia\" means \"clean,\" because we want to empower\\nand we want to inspire citizens. If citizens don\\'t get engaged, clean transportation decisions\\nwill be bogged down by endless, and I mean endless, technical discussions, and by avalanches of lobbying\\nby various established interests. Wanting to be a green country\\npowered by renewables is already part of our story. We should not let anybody\\ntake that away from us. Last year, we brought people\\nfrom our seven provinces to talk about climate change\\nin terms that matter to them, and we also brought this year another group of Costa Ricans to talk about renewable energy. And you know what? These people disagree on almost everything except on renewable energy and clean transportation and clean air. It brings people together. And the key to real participation is to help people not to feel small. People feel powerless, and they are tired of not being heard. So what we do is concrete things, and we translate technical issues\\ninto citizen language to show that citizens have a role to play\\nand can play it together. For the first time, we\\'re tracking\\nthe promises that were made on clean transportation, and politicos know\\nthat they have to deliver it, but the tipping point will come\\nwhen we form coalitions -- citizens, companies, champions of public transportation -- that will make electric mobility\\nthe new normal, especially in a developing country. By the time the next election comes, I believe every candidate\\nwill have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels. Because this question\\nhas to enter our mainstream politics. And I\\'m telling you,\\nthis is not a question of climate policy or environmental agenda. It\\'s about the country that we want and the cities that we have and the cities that we want and who makes that choice. Because at the end of the day,\\nwhat we have to show is that development with renewable energy is good for the people, for Costa Ricans that are alive today and especially for those\\nwho haven\\'t been born. This is our National Museum today. It\\'s bright and peaceful, and when you stand up in front of it, it\\'s really hard to believe\\nthese were military barracks at the end of the \\'40s. We started a new life\\nwithout an army in this place, and here is where our abolition of fossil fuels will be announced one day. And we will make history again. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi\\'s air. My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent, and it was killing me. With the help of IIT, TERI, and learnings from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants, with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy. We\\'ve also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building, while maintaining industry indoor air-quality standards. The three plants are Areca palm, Mother-in-Law\\'s Tongue and money plant. The botanical names are in front of you. Areca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen. We need four shoulder-high plants per person, and in terms of plant care, we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi, and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities. We had to grow them in vermi manure, which is sterile, or hydroponics, and take them outdoors every three to four months. The second plant is Mother-in-law\\'s Tongue, which is again a very common plant, and we call it a bedroom plant, because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night. And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person. The third plant is money plant, and this is again a very common plant; preferably grows in hydroponics. And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals. With these three plants, you can grow all the fresh air you need. In fact, you could be in a bottle with a cap on top, and you would not die at all, and you would not need any fresh air. We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi, which is a 50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building. And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants. Our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one\\'s blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours. The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi. And the study showed that, compared to other buildings, there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent, respiratory systems by 34 percent, headaches by 24 percent, lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent. And this study has been published on September 8, 2008, and it\\'s available on the government of India website. Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants. And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air. We are now replicating this in a 1.75-million-square-feet building, which will have 60,000 indoor plants. Why is this important? It is also important for the environment, because the world\\'s energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade. 40 percent of the world\\'s energy is taken up by buildings currently, and 60 percent of the world\\'s population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years. And there is a growing preference for living and working in air-conditioned places. \"Be the change you want to see in the world,\" said Mahatma Gandhi. And thank you for listening. (Applause)', '\"How many times must a man look up Before he can see the sky?\" That\\'s a quote from\\na famous song by Bob Dylan. I love that line because it reminds me that sometimes what we need is actually\\nright there in front of us. I will argue that that is also the case\\nwith climate change. We can actually replace some\\nof the biggest sources of the problem, oil, coal and gas, with something we have in abundance: wind. In my country, Denmark,\\nwe are doing just that. Now we are a small country\\nwith a small population. If you haven\\'t visited yet, please do so. We are all friendly people. As long as you don\\'t criticize\\nour national football team. (Laughter) Nothing makes a Dane proud like the knowledge\\nthat something we have done makes a positive difference in the world. Historically speaking,\\nwe’ve made a difference before. 1,000 years ago, countrymen of mine\\ncontrolled most of northern Europe. I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard of them. Big, strong guys,\\nhelmets, beards, long hair. The Vikings. Now I will make the case today that in order for us\\nto fight climate change, we actually need to learn\\nfrom the Vikings. But before we get to that,\\nplease indulge me. We have to go somewhere else. I have to say go back in time. Not all the way back to the Viking age\\nin the heydays of Harald \"Bluetooth,\" but to the 1970s during the oil crisis in Denmark. Not to a Viking fortress, but to a small workshop,\\nin a barn, in a farm, in a village in Denmark. Meets Henrik Stiesdal. He’s not an accomplished,\\nexperienced engineer. He\\'s 19 years old, a young man. He set himself a challenge. He thought, \"What if I could make a wind turbine\\nthat could produce electricity?\" And you know what? He did. How do I know? Because that\\'s it. Not a model, not a replica. This is the actual one that Henrik made. He was kind enough to lend it to me. It says M1 on it. That stands for \"mølle one,\" \"mølle et\" which translates\\ninto \"turbine number one.\" And of course, this was just\\nthe first one he made. Later, he managed to build a big one that could supply his family with cheap,\\naffordable electricity in the middle of the crisis. And soon after that, other farms asked Henrik\\nto build a turbine for them as well. And he did. And eventually he actually sold the design to a company called Vestas. You might have heard of them because they are the biggest\\nturbine producer in the world today. So this is how Henrik’s invention became a sort of the prototype for many,\\nmany of the wind turbines that you\\'ll see all over the planet today. Now a lot of things have happened\\nsince Henrik and other pioneers took the first steps back in the 1970s. In 1991, we built the first offshore wind farm\\nin the world called Vindeby. Eleven turbines, 54 meters tall. That was considered a landmark. They were huge. Today, of course, they seem pretty tiny. This is Kriegers Flak. That\\'s the biggest offshore\\nwind farm in Denmark now. 72 turbines, 188 meters tall, each of them. To give you a comparison, that\\'s twice the height\\nof the Statue of Liberty. Every time one of those turbines\\nhas one rotation of the blades, it creates enough electricity\\nto charge more than 1,400 cell phones. The park itself covers the electricity\\ndemand of 600,000 households. So the story of wind power in Denmark is the story about how one turbine, on one farm sparked a transformation\\nthat influenced the whole country. We, of course, now hope, small as we may be, that we can spark a transformation\\nthat will also affect other countries. We are a green frontrunner, but we need to do more\\nbecause at the same time, we rank number one in the EU, or at least as one of the biggest\\noil producers, in the EU. This has to change. And it will. Last year, the Danish government\\nand the Danish parliament made an important decision. We’ve decided to put an end date\\non extraction of oil and gas in 2050 and immediately cancel\\nall future licensing rounds. (Applause) That wasn\\'t an easy decision. When we made the decision, we were the biggest\\noil producer in the EU. But the reason we made it,\\neven though it was expensive, was because we need to show the world that there are actually\\nalternatives to oil and gas. Now, some of you are probably thinking\\nthat sounds very good, but how will you do it? What do you do the days\\nwhen the wind doesn\\'t blow? And what about the parts of our energy\\nsystem that cannot be electrified? Surely you cannot fly a jet plane\\nwithout jet fuels? Surely you cannot sail\\na big container ship without bunker oil? But actually, you can. This is an electrolyzer. The photo is from a visit I paid\\na factory in Denmark a few weeks ago. So it\\'s not a prototype,\\nit\\'s not a model in a lab. It\\'s a functioning machine,\\nit\\'s a commercial product. What does it do? It transforms electricity into hydrogen. And that, friends,\\nthat\\'s the game changer. Because it makes it possible for us to solve two problems\\nwe have with wind energy. One, we can now store the energy\\nfor when the wind is not blowing. And two, we can now decarbonize\\nparts of our energy system that we couldn\\'t decarbonize before. Because the hydrogen\\ncan be transformed into green fuels. Imagine that. The wind in the North Sea is transformed\\nby a turbine into electricity. The electrolyzer transforms\\nthat into hydrogen, and the hydrogen is then made\\ninto green, sustainable fuels that we can use to sail our ships\\nand fly our planes. I know it sounds like science fiction,\\nbut actually it\\'s just science. Now in order for us to do that\\nat a scale that we need, we will need a lot of renewable energy. We will need to massively expand\\nour offshore wind capacity. And in Denmark, we\\'re doing just that. A very important part of that strategy is to build the world\\'s\\nfirst energy island. This is a simulation\\nof what it may end up looking like. 80 kilometers out in the sea, the size of 64 football fields, the biggest infrastructure\\ninvestment in Danish history. We\\'re changing literally\\nthe map of our country. Hundreds of wind turbines around it. When fully scaled, it\\'ll be able to generate\\n10 gigawatts of green electricity. Now 10 gigawatts, that\\'s enough to cover the demand\\nof 10 million households. That\\'s far more than we need\\nin Denmark, which is good news, because then we can use it\\nto make the hydrogen, to make the green fuels, and we can export it to other countries and thereby help them decarbonize\\ntheir energy systems. Some of you are probably thinking, \"What does this have to do\\nwith the Vikings?\" But do you know what it was\\nthat made the Vikings so successful? How they managed to go to Greenland? How they managed to sail to America\\n500 years before Christopher Columbus? Their secret? They exploited the wind. They put tremendous effort\\ninto making efficient sails, and it took as a long time for them\\nto make a sail as it did to build a ship, and it was just as important. And that brings me to my main point. We need, as the Vikings did\\n1,000 years ago, to change the world by finding new\\nand more efficient ways of exploiting the energy. This time, with slightly\\nbetter haircuts -- (Laughter) and the motivation that lies in the fact that this may be our biggest chance of making a positive difference\\nin fighting climate change. Now, some people will probably tell you that a small country\\ncannot make a big difference. I beg to differ. When a young man like Henrik could make a difference\\nfor a whole country, why not also believe\\nthat a country like Denmark can make a difference for a whole world? We can\\'t do it alone, but we can do a lot. By innovating, by creating new technology\\nand new solutions, by exploiting something\\nthat is much bigger than ourselves, the forces of nature. If you ask the International\\nEnergy Agency, they will tell you that offshore wind has the potential to cover\\nthe current electricity demand of the entire world, not once, not twice, 18 times. So when you go to Denmark, you’ll meet a Dane. After you have said something nice\\nabout our football team, (Chuckles) try and ask her, \"How do you think we should solve\\nthe climate crisis?\" Chances are, she will say, \"The answer, my friend,\\nis literally blowing in the wind.\" (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) [Take action on climate change\\nat countdown.ted.com]', 'So, I\\'m from Guatemala. This is a public service announcement, that is where Guatemala is. (Laughter) Also, that is not\\nwhere they keep the prisoners. That is called Guantanamo. (Laughter) Not the same place. So Guatemala\\'s right below Mexico. And for the Americans in the audience, and let this sink in,\\nbecause it really applies in most ways, for the Americans in the audience, you can think of it as Mexico\\'s Mexico. (Laughter) Just like the US doesn\\'t want\\nillegal immigration from Mexico, Mexico doesn\\'t want\\nillegal immigration from Guatemala. It\\'s a smaller country. It\\'s a poor country. And well, what can I tell you, it has much better Mexican food. (Laughter) Guatemala is a very poor country. And a lot of people talk about education as something that brings equality\\nto different social classes. But I always saw it as the opposite,\\nas something that brings inequality. Because what happens in practice is that people who have a lot of money\\ncan buy themselves a really good education and therefore continue\\nhaving a lot of money. Whereas people who don\\'t have\\nvery much money barely learn how to read and write and therefore never make a lot of money. And this is especially true\\nin poor countries. Now, I was fortunate that I received\\na rich person\\'s education even though I didn\\'t grow up rich. And it’s because I’m an only child. And my mother, who was a single mother, spent all of her resources\\non my education. And this allowed me to come\\nto college to the US and eventually get a PhD\\nin computer science. Now because of all of this about 10 years ago, I decided I wanted to do something that would give equal access\\nto education to everyone. Oh, by the way, this is what I want\\nto talk to you about today, giving equal access\\nto education to everyone. At the time, I was a professor\\nof computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and I decided to work on this\\nwith my PhD student, Severin. The way my brain works, all of education is just\\ntoo general of a problem. So I decided, let\\'s start\\nby teaching one thing. And then I started thinking,\\nOK, well, what should we teach first? Should we teach math? I mean, we both love math. Me and my cofounder, we both love math. And, you know, we didn\\'t\\ndecide to do math. Then we started thinking, well, maybe\\nwe should teach computer science. But eventually, and this is maybe\\nsurprising to people in North America, eventually, we decided\\nthat the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages. And let me tell you why. There\\'s a number of reasons. One of them is that there\\'s\\na huge audience for it. There’s about two billion people\\nin the world learning a foreign language, both in school and outside of schools. Most of these people, by the way,\\nare learning English. About 80 percent of them\\nare learning English. In this weird map right here, all the countries in green are countries in which people\\nare predominantly learning English. And the reason for that is because English can truly\\ntransform your life. In most countries in the world, knowledge of English can significantly\\nincrease your income potential. So this is another reason why we decided\\nto start with foreign languages. And it\\'s because you can directly\\nmake more money if you learn another language,\\nin particular English. And see, this is pretty different\\nthan many other subjects. For example, take math. In the case of math, just knowledge of math does not\\nincrease your income potential because usually you have to learn math\\nto then learn physics to then become a civil engineer,\\nthat\\'s how you make more money. Whereas with languages,\\nif you are a waiter and you learn English, now you can be a waiter at a hotel\\nand make more money. So we decided, well, let\\'s get started\\nby teaching languages. Now, we also convinced ourselves that the only way\\nto really reach a lot of people was by using a mobile phone,\\nor a smartphone in particular. See, building schools all over the world\\nis simply too expensive. On the other hand, most of the world\\'s population\\nalready has access to a smartphone, and the trend is that that fraction\\nis only going to increase. So we decided at the time that we would make a way to learn\\nforeign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone. And then we called it Duolingo. Thank you. (Applause) Now in order to truly be accessible\\nto everyone, rich and poor, Duolingo uses a freemium model\\nto support itself. What that means is that you can learn\\nas much as you want without ever having to pay. But if you don\\'t pay, you may have to see an ad\\nat the end of a lesson. Now, if you don\\'t like ads, you can also pay to subscribe\\nto turn off the ads. And it turns out that the vast majority\\nof the revenue for Duolingo comes from people who pay\\nto subscribe to turn off the ads. Now, who are these people who pay\\nto subscribe to turn off the ads? Well, they\\'re usually well-off people\\nin rich countries like the US and Canada. Who are the people\\nwho don\\'t pay to subscribe? They usually come from poorer countries\\nlike Brazil or Vietnam or Guatemala. So what I like about this model is that it is a small form\\nof wealth redistribution because we\\'re basically\\ngetting the rich people to pay for the education of everyone. So I like that. (Applause) So with smartphones,\\nwe can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people\\nto pay for the whole thing, which is great. However, if you\\'re trying to deliver\\neducation with a smartphone, you run into a humongous problem. And it is that smartphones come equipped with some of the most addictive drugs\\nthat humanity has ever engineered. TikTok, Instagram, mobile games. See, delivering education\\nover a smartphone is like hoping that people\\nwill eat their broccoli, but right next to it, you put\\nthe most delicious dessert ever made. (Laughter) If you really want to deliver\\neducation to everyone, not only do you have\\nto make it accessible, but also you have to make it\\nso that people want to actually learn. And with Duolingo,\\nwe\\'ve been able to do this. And at the highest level,\\nthe way we\\'ve done this is by making the broccoli\\ntaste like dessert. I\\'ll say it another way. What we\\'ve done is that we\\'ve used\\nthe same psychological techniques that apps like Instagram,\\nTikTok or mobile games use to keep people engaged, but in this case, we use them\\nto keep people engaged but with education. Let me give you some examples\\nof these techniques. One of the most powerful ones\\nis the notion of a streak. What a streak is, is it’s just a counter that measures the number of days that you\\'ve used\\nthe product consecutively. You just take that number, you put it very prominently\\nin your product and then people come back every day. And the reason people come back\\nevery day is because, well, if they don\\'t come back,\\nthat number resets to zero and people don\\'t want\\nto lose their streak. It works. Now, on the one side, streaks have been criticized\\nfor, for example, getting teens addicted to Snapchat. But in the case of an educational app, streaks get people to come back\\nto study every day. Now, to give you an idea\\nof the power of streaks, in the case of Duolingo, we have over three million\\ndaily active users that have a streak longer than 365. (Applause) That means they haven\\'t missed a day\\nin the last year or longer. Now, fun fact about streaks. What country do you think\\nhas the longest average streaks for an educational app? It\\'s Japan. Of course. Shortest-ever streaks? Latin America, baby. (Laughter) But we\\'re fun, hey, we\\'re fun. (Laughter) Another important mechanism to get people\\nto come back to your product are notifications. On the one side, notifications\\ncan be really spammy and annoying, but in the case of an educational product, people actually want\\nto be reminded to learn. In the case of Duolingo, we have\\na very sophisticated AI system that basically chooses\\nwhen to send the notification and also what to say in each notification to maximize the probability\\nthat people come back. Now, interestingly, even after all this sophistication, it turns out that the algorithm\\nfor choosing what time to send you a notification\\nis pretty simple. Do you know what is the best time\\nto send people a notification? I\\'ll tell you. It\\'s 24 hours after\\nthey used the product last. There\\'s an easy explanation. If you were free yesterday at 3pm, you’re probably free today\\nat 3pm as well. So this is what a very sophisticated\\nmillions of dollars of AI found. (Laughter) It\\'s funny. Now with notifications\\nyou shouldn\\'t be spamming. And we\\'re not spamming, with Duolingo, we actually stop sending notifications\\nafter seven days of inactivity. So if you don\\'t use Duolingo\\nfor seven days, we stop sending you notifications. Now, at some point it occurred to us, if we\\'re stopping\\nto send people notifications, we should let them know. So we started sending\\nthis notification to people saying, \"Hey, these reminders\\ndon\\'t seem to be working. We\\'ll stop sending them for now.\" You know what people do\\nwhen they get this notification? They come back. (Laughter) Passive aggressive. (Laughter) Works for my mother, works for Duolingo. (Laughter and applause) These passive aggressive notifications are really good at getting\\npeople to come back back because they feel like our green\\nowl mascot has given up on them, so they come back. And speaking of our\\ngreen owl mascot, by the way, because all our notifications come\\nfrom our green owl mascot and well, he\\'s passive aggressive\\nand also pretty pushy, this has given rise to a lot\\nof memes on the internet that make fun of the great lengths\\nthat he will go through to get you back to learn a language. Here\\'s one of my favorite ones. This is it\\'s a meme,\\nit’s one of my favorite ones. (Laughter) Basically looks like you forgot\\nyour Spanish lessons. And then there\\'s an intruder alert, presumably the owl broke into your house\\nto get you to learn language. Now, Duolingo has entered the zeitgeist. And there\\'s thousands of memes,\\nthere\\'s SNL skits about it. And it\\'s because we\\'ve managed\\nto get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that mobile games and social media use\\nto get people engaged. And this is a really important point, let me say this. I don\\'t actually believe that there\\'s\\na way to make an educational app be as engaging as something like TikTok\\nor Instagram or mobile games. But the good news is that -- And by the way, the reason\\nI don\\'t believe that is because ultimately you have\\nto teach people something. And it\\'s hard to compete with,\\nlike, cats and celebrities. But the good news is\\nthat I don\\'t think you have to. See, here\\'s the thing. When you\\'re learning something,\\nyou get meaning out of it. Whereas when you\\'re scrolling\\nfor two hours on Instagram, a lot of times afterwards, you feel\\nlike you just wasted your time. So I think it\\'s actually OK\\nif your educational product is only 80 or 90 percent as engaging\\nas something like TikTok, because the other 10 or 20 percent will be provided\\nby people\\'s internal motivation, though of course, not much more than that. This is really a key point. If we want to get people\\nto do something meaningful, you can use the same techniques\\nthat apps like social media use to get people to do it. And even if you\\'re not as engaging\\nas those apps are, you can still get hundreds of millions\\nof people to use your product. In the case of Duolingo, for example, there are more people learning languages\\non Duolingo in the United States than there are people learning languages\\nacross all US high schools combined. (Applause) And this is true\\nin most countries in the world. My hope is that -- I know\\nwe can do this, but, you know, my hope is that as humanity, we can do what Duolingo has done\\nfor learning languages but for all other subjects. Where we can get people\\nto learn math with mobile phones, like millions of people to learn\\nmath with mobile phones or physics or whatever. I hope for a future in which\\nscreen time is not a bad thing, in which we can deliver high-quality\\neducation to everyone, rich or poor, using a mobile phone. But the single most important thing\\nthat I can end this talk with, is a reminder to please,\\npretty please, I beg you, do your language lessons today. Thank you very much. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Luis, thank you so much. I wonder if you can just say\\na little bit more about that last point, how do you think you can apply\\nthis type of thinking to other subjects? So you mentioned math,\\nand things like that. How do you do that? Luis von Ahn: I think in particular, subjects that are learned\\nthrough repetition and it turns out most things\\nthat are kind of really meaningful are learned through\\nthousands of repetitions. You learn to read through repetition, you learn elementary school math\\nthrough repetition. Most things that you can learn\\nthrough repetition, you can actually gamify\\nand turn into something like Duolingo, where people just\\ndo it a lot and do it fun. It\\'s a little harder for things\\nlike explanations. That probably is going to require\\nsome really good videos. Sal Khan is doing a really\\ngood job with that. But for things that require\\na lot of repetition, I think we can use the same methods. (Applause)', \"So the world is going electric. And batteries will do for electrification\\nwhat the refrigerator did for food, because batteries will allow us\\nto move clean energy through time and through space. And we don't have a problem\\nwith the availability of energy on this planet. We have a problem with getting this energy\\nto where we need it, and when we need it. But if we approach battery\\nmanufacturing the wrong way, we will end up repeating\\nmistakes from the past, mistakes that are at the heart\\nof the climate environmental crisis that we see today. And that's what I'm here to explain. It's all about the way\\nwe are using the Earth's resources. So historically, and today, we have been mining oil\\nfrom the Earth's crust with little concern\\nfor the long-term effect. And this example of how we’ve been\\napproaching the fossil fuel industry and how we've been dependent on it, how we have been extracting oil\\nwhere it's economically possible, refined it, burned it,\\nand it ends up in the atmosphere -- that's the perfect illustration of the fundamental,\\nsimple and linear model that we are working with: extract, use and discard. When I was a professor\\nin environmental engineering, I used to teach my students\\nthat mistakes are OK, as long as you learn from your mistakes, and as long as you take action. So now, when we are evolving, when we are changing, when we are building things from scratch, we should think twice,\\nand we should do it right this time. And what does this mean for batteries? There are two things\\nwe need to know about batteries. One is they require enormous amounts\\nof energy to produce, and the second is that they are\\nmade from minerals, minerals that require global mining,\\nrefining and processing, and long and complex supply chains. So if we start with energy, a battery factory is a very large\\nand complex operation. It requires large amounts of heat\\nand electricity to produce. It starts with a chemical plant; then follow long coating machines. After that, we have cell assembly, which is fine electronics equipment\\nthat require clean and dry rooms. Now at the end of this process, each and every battery cell needs to be charged and discharged\\nin certain patterns to gain its properties. And if we put this kind of factory\\nunder a fossil fuel grid, we will end up with a carbon footprint, which is the benchmark today, which is around 100 kilograms\\nof carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of produced battery. And how much is that? If we take it at scale, 20, 30 years ... of battery manufacturing will give the total footprint\\nof about half the size of Germany's. Now that would be a big mistake. Luckily, you can slash that footprint\\nby some 67 percent -- that's two-thirds -- if you put the same operation\\non the renewable energy grid, which we do, in northern Sweden. That, on the other hand,\\nleaves us with the remaining footprint, the last third, coming entirely from everything\\nthat is outside the factory, and the lion's part from the supply chain. And that leads us to the second topic\\nwe have to talk about, which is the minerals. So batteries are made from minerals -- for example, nickel, cobalt and lithium -- and the way we approach this\\nis going to determine how much we can further slash\\nthat carbon footprint. Luckily, if we put it\\nunder this renewable grid, if we approach it the right way, with sustainable mining\\nand a lot of recycling, we can significantly reduce the footprint. One tonne of battery-grade lithium requires 750 tonnes of brine or 250 tonnes of lithium ore. Same with cobalt -- if you need one tonne\\nof battery-grade cobalt, you have to mine 300 tonnes of cobalt ore. So does this give us a similar situation\\nto the oil history we have? No, because the difference\\nis that when we mine metals, they are elements. And if you can get elements back\\nto their elemental form, they are just as good as new. And this is the fundamental difference between the combustion-engine history\\nthat we're living now and the new electric vehicle industry. Because at the end of the life cycle, you can bring the metals\\nback from the market, and you can use them again and again. So what we have developed at Northvolt\\nis a recycling process, where we take the batteries\\nback from the market, we discharge them fully, we take away the aluminum casing, we take away all the cabling, and then, we take out\\nthe cells and the modules. We take those cells and modules, together with some waste material\\nwe have from the production, and we throw it into a big shredder. We chop it up. We take out the copper foil,\\naluminum foil, some plastics. And then, we are left with something\\nthat we call the black mass. And this black mass\\nis a fine black powder. This fine black powder consists of everything that we had coated\\non the electrodes in the factory. It's the graphite from the anode, and it's the nickel, cobalt,\\nmanganese and lithium from the cathode. We take this fine powder, the black mass, we pass it on into\\nthe hydrometallurgical process ... Hydrometallurgy\\nmeans treating metal in liquid. And what we do is that we use different pressure changes,\\ntemperature changes and pH to separate them from one another. We refine them, so we get them\\ninto the form that we need for the production -- salts for nickel, cobalt and manganese, or hydroxides for lithium. And then, we do like this. We send them across site,\\nstraight into production. So what we have\\nis a circular battery economy. And this is the fundamental difference\\nbetween the combustion-engine industry and what we are building now. We should do this not only for batteries. We should do it for wind turbines,\\nwe should do it for solar panels, we should do it for all the new industries\\nthat we need for this transformation. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause continues) And we're going to have to accept mining\\nas part of this transition, absolutely. But when we are taking things\\nfrom the Earth's crust, when we are borrowing\\nfrom the future generations, we have to do it responsibly, and we have to make sure\\nthat we can use these materials over and over, and over again, because fundamentally, we can. And we should not only build\\nrecycling processes and a port for the materials\\nwhen they come to their end of life -- we should also build\\naccounting and traceability systems so that each carmaker\\ncan follow up and trace how much they can further slash\\ntheir footprint by sending the batteries back\\nat the end of their life. And why we are doing this -- I'm sure you've already\\nfigured this out -- it's not only environmentally beneficial, it's also, of course,\\neconomically profitable, because by doing this, the material sustains its value\\nthrough the lifetime. And this altogether\\nmay sound a little bit hard, it may sound a little bit complex, but if we get this right, it will be rewarding on so many levels. And I can tell you\\nthat the young generation of talented engineers\\nthat we hire today, they understand all this, and they ask nothing less from us. So with that said, I just want to say\\nto all of you who listened, and I also want to say to all the people who packed their bags\\nand moved up to the Nordics, who are fighting every day\\nto make this happen, thank you. (Cheers and applause)\", 'Fifteen years ago, I thought that the diversity stuff\\nwas not something I had to worry about. It was something an older\\ngeneration had to fight for. In my university,\\nwe were 50-50, male-female, and we women often had better grades. So while not everything was perfect, diversity and leadership decisions was something that would happen\\nnaturally over time, right? Well, not quite. While moving up the ladder\\nworking as a management consultant across Europe and the US, I started to realize how often\\nI was the only woman in the room and how homogenous leadership still is. Many leaders I met saw diversity as something to comply with\\nout of political correctness, or, best case, the right thing to do, but not as a business priority. They just did not have a reason to believe that diversity would help them achieve\\ntheir most immediate, pressing goals: hitting the numbers,\\ndelivering the new product, the real goals they are measured by. My personal experience\\nworking with diverse teams had been that while they require\\na little bit more effort at the beginning, they did bring fresher,\\nmore creative ideas. So I wanted to know: Are diverse organizations\\nreally more innovative, and can diversity be more\\nthan something to comply with? Can it be a real competitive advantage? So to find out, we set up a study\\nwith the Technical University of Munich. We surveyed 171 companies\\nin Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and as we speak, we\\'re expanding the study to 1,600 companies in five additional countries\\naround the world. We asked those companies\\nbasically two things: how innovative they are\\nand how diverse they are. To measure the first one, we asked them about innovation revenue. Innovation revenue is the share\\nof revenues they\\'ve made from new products and services\\nin the last three years, meaning we did not ask them\\nhow many creative ideas they have, but rather if these ideas\\ntranslate into products and services that really make the company\\nmore successful today and tomorrow. To measure diversity,\\nwe looked at six different factors: country of origin,\\nage and gender, amongst others. While preparing to go in the field\\nwith those questions, I sat down with my team and we discussed what\\nwe would expect as a result. To put it mildly, we were not optimistic. The most skeptical person on the team\\nthought, or saw a real possibility, that we would find nothing at all. Most of the team\\nwas rather on the cautious side, so we landed all together at \"only if,\" meaning that we might find\\nsome kind of link between innovation and diversity, but not across the board -- rather only if certain criteria are met, for example leadership style,\\nvery open leadership style that allowed people to speak up freely\\nand safely and contribute. A couple of months later,\\nthe data came in, and the results convinced\\nthe most skeptical amongst us. The answer was a clear yes, no ifs, no buts. The data in our sample showed that more diverse companies\\nare simply more innovative, period. Now, a fair question to ask\\nis the chicken or the egg question, meaning, are companies\\nreally more innovative because they have\\na more diverse leadership, or the other way around? Which way is it? Now, we do not know how much\\nis correlation versus causation, but what we do know is that clearly, in our sample, companies\\nthat are more diverse are more innovative, and that companies\\nthat are more innovative have more diverse leadership, too. So it\\'s fair to assume\\nthat it works both ways, diversity driving innovation\\nand innovation driving diversity. Now, once we published the results, we were surprised\\nabout the reactions in the media. We got quite some attention. And it went from quite factual, like \"Higher Female Share\\nBoosts Innovation\" to a little bit more sensationalist. (Laughter) As you can see, \"Stay-at-home Women Cost Trillions,\" and, my personal favorite, \"Housewives Kill Innovation.\" Well, there\\'s no such thing\\nas bad publicity, right? (Laughter) On the back of that coverage, we started to get calls\\nfrom senior executives wanting to understand more, especially -- surprise, surprise --\\nabout gender diversity. I tend to open up\\nthose discussions by asking, \"Well, what do you think of the situation\\nin your organization today?\" And a frequent reaction to that is, \"Well, we\\'re not yet there,\\nbut we\\'re not that bad.\" One executive told me, for example, \"Oh, we\\'re not that bad. We have one member\\nin our board who is a woman.\" (Laughter) And you laugh -- (Applause) Now, you laugh, but he had a point\\nin being proud about it, because in Germany, if you have a company and it has one member\\non the board who is a woman, you are part of a select group of 30 out of the 100 largest\\npublicly listed companies. The other 70 companies\\nhave an all-male board, and not even one of these hundred\\nlargest publicly listed companies have, as of today, a female CEO. But here\\'s the critically\\nimportant insight. Those few female board members alone, they won\\'t make a difference. Our data shows that for gender diversity\\nto have an impact on innovation, you need to have more\\nthan 20 percent women in leadership. Let\\'s have a look at the numbers. As you can see, we divided\\nthe sample into three groups, and the results are quite dramatic. Only in the group where you have\\nmore than 20 percent women in leadership, only then you see a clear jump\\nin innovation revenue to above-average levels. So experience and data\\nshows that you do need critical mass to move the needle, and companies like Alibaba,\\nJP Morgan or Apple have as of today\\nalready achieved that threshold. Another reaction I got quite a lot was, \"Well, it will get solved over time.\" And I have all the sympathy in the world\\nfor that point of view, because I used to think like that, too. Now, let\\'s have a look here again\\nand look at the numbers, taking Germany as an example. Let me first give you the good news. So the share of women\\nwho are college graduates and have at least 10 years\\nof professional experience has grown nicely over the last 20 years, which means the pool\\nin which to fish for female leaders has increased over time, and that\\'s great. Now, according to my old theory, the share of women in leadership would have grown\\nmore or less in parallel, right? Now, let\\'s have a look\\nat what happened in reality. It\\'s not even close, which means I was so wrong and which means that my generation, your generation, the best-educated\\nfemale generation in history, we have just not made it. We have failed to achieve leadership\\nin significant numbers. Education just did not\\ntranslate into leadership. Now, that was a painful realization for me and made me realize, if we want to change this, we need to engage,\\nand we need to do better. Now, what to do? Achieving more than 20 percent\\nwomen in leadership seems like a daunting task to many, understandably, given the track record. But it\\'s doable, and there are many companies today\\nthat are making progress there and doing it successfully. Let\\'s take SAP, the software\\ncompany, as an example. They had, in 2011,\\n19 percent women in leadership, yet they decided to do better, and they did what you do\\nin any other area of business where you want to improve. They set themselves a measurable target. So they set themselves a target\\nof 25 percent for 2017, which they have just achieved. The goals made them think more creatively\\nabout developing leaders and tapping new recruiting pools. They now even set a target of 30 percent\\nwomen in leadership for 2022. So experience shows it\\'s doable, and at the end of the day, it all boils down to two decisions\\nthat are taken every day in every organization by many of us: who to hire and who\\nto develop and promote. Now, nothing against women\\'s programs, networks, mentoring, trainings. All is good. But it is these two decisions that at the end of the day\\nsend the most powerful change signal in any organization. Now, I never set out\\nto be a diversity advocate. I am a business advisor. But now my goal is\\nto change the face of leadership, to make it more diverse -- and not so that leaders can check a box and feel like they have\\ncomplied with something or they have been politically correct. But because they understand, they understand that diversity\\nis making their organization more innovative, better. And by embracing diversity,\\nby embracing diverse talent, we are providing\\ntrue opportunity for everyone. Thank you. Thank you so much. (Applause)', 'Translator: Joseph Geni\\nReviewer: Morton Bast Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone. You know that all over the world, people fight for their freedom, fight for their rights. Some battle oppressive governments. Others battle oppressive societies. Which battle do you think is harder? Allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes. Let me take you back two years ago in my life. It was the bedtime of my son, Aboody. He was five at the time. After finishing his bedtime rituals, he looked at me and he asked a question: \"Mommy, are we bad people?\" I was shocked. \"Why do you say such things, Aboody?\" Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school. He wouldn\\'t tell me what happened. [But now] he was ready to tell. \"Two boys hit me today in school. They told me, \\'We saw your mom on Facebook. You and your mom should be put in jail.\\'\" I\\'ve never been afraid to tell Aboody anything. I\\'ve been always a proud woman of my achievements. But those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth, when it all came together. You see, I\\'m a Saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars. Just for giving me his car keys, my own brother was detained twice, and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist, leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son. My father had to sit in a Friday sermon listening to the imam condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes amongst tons of worshippers, some of them our friends and family of my own father. I was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings, in the streets and in schools. It all hit me. It came into focus that those kids did not mean to be rude to my son. They were just influenced by the adults around them. And it wasn\\'t about me, and it wasn\\'t a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles. It was a punishment for daring to challenge the society\\'s rules. But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine. Allow me to give you a briefing about my story. It was May, 2011, and I was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments I had to face trying to find a ride back home, although I have a car and an international driver\\'s license. As long as I\\'ve known, women in Saudi Arabia have been always complaining about the ban, but it\\'s been 20 years since anyone tried to do anything about it, a whole generation ago. He broke the good/bad news in my face. \"But there is no law banning you from driving.\" I looked it up, and he was right. There wasn\\'t an actual law in Saudi Arabia. It was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women. That realization ignited the idea of June 17, where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive. It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these \"Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive.\" A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri, she\\'s a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah, she drove a car and she announced but she didn\\'t record a video. We needed proof. So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube. And to my surprise, it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day. What happened next, of course? I started receiving threats to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign. The Saudi authorities remained very quiet. That really creeped us out. I was in the campaign with other Saudi women and even men activists. We wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day, June 17, when women go out and drive. So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car. It went fast. We were arrested, signed a pledge not to drive again, released. Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day, and I was sent to jail. I wasn\\'t sure why I was sent there, because I didn\\'t face any charges in the interrogation. But what I was sure of was my innocence. I didn\\'t break a law, and I kept my abaya — it\\'s a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house — and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off, but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying, \"No, I\\'m leaving today.\" Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy, some attacking me badly, and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me. I was released after nine days. June 17 comes. The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars, but some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day. None were arrested. We broke the taboo. (Applause) So I think by now, everyone knows that we can\\'t drive, or women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia, but maybe few know why. Allow me to help you answer this question. There was this official study that was presented to the Shura Council -- it\\'s the consultative council appointed by the king in Saudi Arabia — and it was done by a local professor, a university professor. He claims it\\'s done based on a UNESCO study. And the study states, the percentage of rape, adultery, illegitimate children, even drug abuse, prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don\\'t drive. (Laughter) I know, I was like this, I was shocked. I was like, \"We are the last country in the world where women don\\'t drive.\" So if you look at the map of the world, that only leaves two countries: Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world. We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study, and it made headlines around the world. [BBC News: \\'End of virginity\\' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns] (Laughter) And only then we realized it\\'s so empowering to mock your oppressor. It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear. This system is based on ultra-conservative traditions and customs that deal with women as if they are inferior and they need a guardian to protect them, so they need to take permission from this guardian, whether verbal or written, all their lives. We are minors until the day we die. And it becomes worse when it\\'s enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law, or the religious laws. What\\'s worst, when they become codified as laws in the system, and when women themselves believe in their inferiority, and they even fight those who try to question these rules. So for me, it wasn\\'t only about these attacks I had to face. It was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality, of my person -- the villain back in my home country, and the hero outside. Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years. One of them is when I was in jail. I\\'m pretty sure when I was in jail, everyone saw titles in the international media something like this during these nine days I was in jail. But in my home country, it was a totally different picture. It was more like this: \"Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive.\" I know. \"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign.\" Ah, it\\'s okay. This is my favorite. \"Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses: \\'Foreign forces incited me.\\'\" (Laughter) And it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public. So it\\'s a totally different picture. I was asked last year to give a speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum. I was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me, and they looked at me as an inspiration. At the same time, I flew back to my home country, they hated that speech so much. The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country and the Saudi people, and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter. Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag, while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero, there was like a handful of tweets written. They even started a poll. More than 13,000 voters answered this poll: whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech. Ninety percent said yes, she\\'s a traitor. So it\\'s these two totally different perceptions of my personality. For me, I\\'m a proud Saudi woman, and I do love my country, and because I love my country, I\\'m doing this. Because I believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause) Thank you. But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you. I learned to be always there. The first thing, I got out of jail, of course after I took a shower, I went online, I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page, and I\\'ve been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me. I would listen to what they say, and I would never defend myself with words only. I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign, I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver\\'s license. There are a lot of people also -- very big support, like those 3,000 people who signed the petition to release me. We sent a petition to the Shura Council in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women, and there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that and they signed that petition. There were people like that, I just showed some examples, who are amazing, who are believing in women\\'s rights in Saudi Arabia, and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views. Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women\\'s rights. The Shura Council that\\'s appointed by the king, by royal decree of King Abdullah, last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council, like 20 percent. 20 percent of the Council. (Applause) The same time, finally, that Council, after rejecting our petition four times for women driving, they finally accepted it last February. (Applause) After being sent to jail or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial, the spokesperson of the traffic police said, we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers. The Grand Mufti, who is the head of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia, he said, it\\'s not recommended for women to drive. It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti. So for me, it\\'s not about only these small steps. It\\'s about women themselves. A friend once asked me, she said, \"So when do you think this women driving will happen?\" I told her, \"Only if women stop asking \\'When?\\' and take action to make it now.\" So it\\'s not only about the system, it\\'s also about us women to drive our own life, I\\'d say. So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist. And I don\\'t know how I became one now. But all I know, and all I\\'m sure of, in the future when someone asks me my story, I will say, \"I\\'m proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban, fought the ban, and celebrated everyone\\'s freedom.\" So the question I started my talk with, who do you think is more difficult to face, oppressive governments or oppressive societies? I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech. Thank you, everyone. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)', \"How would you react if I told you\\nthat we have an underused screening tool that has the potential\\nto improve women's health substantially? And that this tool only consists\\nof one simple question. Have you had any pregnancy complications? With that simple question, we could identify women at increased risk\\nfor cardiovascular disease later in their lives. That means diseases\\ninvolving the heart, the brain and the blood vessels, like heart attack, heart failure,\\nstroke and high blood pressure. By asking that simple question, we could seek out the women who could benefit\\nfrom general health screening already at a younger age. That means checkups of blood pressure,\\nbody weight and blood sugar. Based on the results, we could offer\\npersonalized lifestyle advice and suggest preventive measures. Why? For this is a fact: cardiovascular disease is a major cause\\nof early death, apart from cancer, not only for men, but also for women. I hope that all of you now\\ngot very curious about what on Earth\\nnine months of pregnancy have to do with older women\\ngetting heart attacks and strokes. Pregnancy is something\\nyounger people do, you might think, even though I would argue\\nthat 50 is the new 30. (Laughter) Pregnancy is often described\\nby a well-used quote as a stress test for life. A woman's health gets tested\\nby being pregnant. Will she tolerate pregnancy and all the involved\\nphysiological changes well, or will there be any complications? The most important organ for pregnancy is the one that was once attached\\nto the center of your belly, where your belly button is. We all have a belly button,\\nregardless of gender. You and I, King Charles,\\nthe Pope, Beyoncé. And where it is,\\nwe were all once connected via a lifeline, the umbilical cord, to the most important organ\\nin both our and our mother's life. You and I, we are all here\\nthanks to our placenta. We all survived the single\\nmost dangerous event in our life, birth, that is, due to our well-enough\\nfunctioning placenta. We all know that the placenta\\nwas our first meal box when we were growing babies\\ninside our mother's womb. Most of us also know that the approximately\\nnine months of growth inside our mothers' womb have lifelong, lasting effects on our health and diseases\\nonce we are outside. But what is lesser-known\\nis that the placenta, the one we were attached to, is crucial for the future\\ncardiovascular health of the mother who lent us a room in her womb. That means how healthy our placenta was is very important for the health\\nof our mother's heart and blood vessels. How is that the case? How does our placenta affect our mother's\\nfuture cardiovascular health? In order to understand that, we must briefly talk\\nabout the makeup of a healthy placenta. This fascinating organ\\nis made early on in pregnancy, when the fertilized egg\\ndevelops into the baby and into cells that invade the layers\\nof the womb of the mother. This happens early on in pregnancy,\\nbefore the baby even looks like a baby. After invading the different\\nwall layers of the mother's womb, the cells group together\\nand form finger-shaped tissue. These tissue fingers\\nseem to poke into the layers. Finally, the healthy placenta\\nincludes a special room where these tissue fingers\\nare showered in the mother's blood. In this shower room, the growing baby receives different\\nlife-important nutrients and signals via different transport mechanisms. In other words, it is very important that everything works well\\nin this specialized room. It has to be nice and tidy. That guarantees\\nthe meal box effect of the placenta. The good effect. But just like almost\\nevery other living things, cells can get stressed,\\nand cells can get out of control. This happens, for example, in cancer. But how can a healthy placenta\\nbecome a stressed placenta? What happens? Placental cells can get stressed when the blood shower\\nin the specialized room gets messy. The placental cells\\nthen get out of control. They grow crazy bumps on their surface. In fact, they seem to literally\\nthrow up stuff into the specialized room. By that, the stressed placental cells\\nsend many different types of signals into the specialized room. And these stress signals\\nthen reach the mother's blood and the mother's blood vessels. And when they reach\\nthe mother's blood vessels, they can make these vessels unhealthy, and they can contribute\\nto making the pregnant woman sick, and the pregnancy gets complicated. The placenta is then\\nnot really healthy anymore. Maybe you've heard of\\nor even know personally, women who have had\\nincreased blood pressure from around the middle of pregnancy, who had protein\\nin their urine or headache, abdominal pain, blurred vision or all of this. Then they had what we call preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication\\nof varied severity that occurs in three to 10 percent\\nof all pregnant women, the rate depending on where we live. What does preeclampsia\\nhave to do with the placenta and with the mother's\\nfuture cardiovascular health? Remember what I told you\\nabout the stressed placenta? According to a widely accepted theory\\nsupported by research, in preeclampsia\\nthe stressed placental cells send signals into the mother's blood. These stress signals\\nmay cause inflammation-like processes in the inner lining\\nof the mother's blood vessels. This then leads\\nto disturbed vessel function and to the signs of preeclampsia\\nthat I mentioned earlier. Preeclampsia is only\\none of several examples for a pregnancy complication\\nrelated to a not-well-working placenta, but I will stick to this example. In a way, the placenta and the mother\\ntalk to each other. And since our earliest cells formed both us, the babies,\\nand the placenta, we talked to our mothers\\neven before we could speak properly. And it turns out that this may well be one of the more important talks\\nwe had with our mothers. So back to the concept\\nof pregnancy as a stress test for life and how stressed placental cells can impact on a mother’s\\nfuture cardiovascular health, decades after she was pregnant\\nand had preeclampsia. How do we know that women\\nafter pregnancy complications are at increased risk\\nfor future cardiovascular disease? In Scandinavia, we have unique access\\nto large population-based data sets containing health information. For many decades, these databases have provided\\nimportant medical knowledge. They tell us that women\\nwho have had preeclampsia towards the end of pregnancy have a doubled risk\\nfor future cardiovascular disease, compared to women who have had\\nuncomplicated pregnancies. I mentioned the meal box function\\nof the placenta. I explained the effect\\nof stressed placental cells and how they send signals to the mother. If the placenta gets even more stressed, the meal box function may be affected. That means the baby\\nhas a lower weight than it should have, in addition to the woman\\ndeveloping preeclampsia. Some babies may even, for various reasons, be born too early, prematurely. For these women with a very, very stressed placenta, the databases tell us that the future cardiovascular disease\\nrisk is even higher, up to four to eightfold higher compared\\nto women with uncomplicated pregnancies. So to sum up what we have\\ntalked about so far, we have databases that give us information\\non pregnancy complications and future cardiovascular health risks. We know that the baby\\nand the placenta and the mother send messages to each other,\\ntalk to each other during pregnancy, but we do not know the exact mechanisms by which complicated pregnancy\\nand the placenta contribute to future\\nhealth risks for women. And this is my point. Much research remains to be done, and the placenta is still full of secrets\\nthat need to be unveiled. But why should we bother anyhow? And how can we identify women\\nat increased risk? And what should we do then? As I said in the beginning. Why? Because cardiovascular diseases are a main cause\\nfor early death also in women. Heart attacks are known\\nto present differently in women compared to men, and may be recognized too late, and that might prove fatal. This is also another good reason for identifying women at increased risk\\nearlier, at a younger age. This is because the earlier\\nthe risk factors are dealt with, the better the effect\\non the blood vessels and the heart. How can we identify women\\nat increased risk? By asking the right questions\\nabout pregnancy at the right time, and whatever the exact cause\\nand the precise mechanism for the association\\nbetween pregnancy complications and cardiovascular disease prove to be, our mothers', sisters', aunts'\\npregnancy history may provide important information\\nfor future health needs. And what should we do then? We could take action at the right time. Women could be offered\\ngeneral health screening at a younger age, including checkups of blood pressure,\\nbody weight and blood sugar. We could give personalized\\nadvice on lifestyle and try to influence other risk factors, such as weight gain, obesity, smoking or type 2 diabetes. This could be done\\neven before women enter their 50s. Is this new medical knowledge? The answer is no. Has this knowledge been acted upon? Not really. Placenta-related pregnancy complications have officially been acknowledged as sex-specific risk factors\\nfor cardiovascular disease by the American Heart Association 11 years ago, and other cardiological societies\\nhave followed their lead. Many guidelines suggest\\nor call for follow-up after pregnancy complications. But we are not aware\\nof any country in the world having a systematic\\ncardiovascular follow-up for women after pregnancy complications already at a younger age. We think such follow-up\\nis of extreme importance for equality in health care\\nand society's survival, since women are important\\nfor society's survival. We think that it should be\\npossible to integrate a simple cardiovascular\\nrisk factor assessment -- measure blood pressure,\\nbody weight and blood sugar -- at the general practitioners into existing screening programs\\nfor cervical dysplasia or other comparable available\\nscreening programs around the world. Tomorrow, when you stand in the shower\\nand look at your belly button, remember the placenta. Remember the one simple question that could improve a mother's health. The one simple question\\nthat could improve cardiovascular health. Have you had any pregnancy complications? (Applause)\", 'I\\'m a storyteller. And I would like to tell you\\na few personal stories about what I like to call\\n\"the danger of the single story.\" I grew up on a university campus\\nin eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started\\nreading at the age of two, although I think four\\nis probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British\\nand American children\\'s books. I was also an early writer, and when I began to write,\\nat about the age of seven, stories in pencil\\nwith crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds\\nof stories I was reading: All my characters were\\nwhite and blue-eyed, they played in the snow, they ate apples, (Laughter) and they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was\\nthat the sun had come out. (Laughter) Now, this despite the fact\\nthat I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn\\'t have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about the weather, because there was no need to. My characters also drank\\na lot of ginger beer, because the characters\\nin the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea\\nwhat ginger beer was. (Laughter) And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire\\nto taste ginger beer. But that is another story. What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable\\nand vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books\\nin which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature\\nhad to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which\\nI could not personally identify. Now, things changed\\nwhen I discovered African books. There weren\\'t many of them available, and they weren\\'t quite as easy to find\\nas the foreign books. But because of writers like\\nChinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went through a mental shift\\nin my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write\\nabout things I recognized. Now, I loved those\\nAmerican and British books I read. They stirred my imagination.\\nThey opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know\\nthat people like me could exist in literature. So what the discovery of African writers\\ndid for me was this: It saved me from having a single story\\nof what books are. I come from a conventional,\\nmiddle-class Nigerian family. My father was a professor. My mother was an administrator. And so we had, as was the norm, live-in domestic help, who would often\\ncome from nearby rural villages. So, the year I turned eight,\\nwe got a new house boy. His name was Fide. The only thing my mother told us about him\\nwas that his family was very poor. My mother sent yams and rice,\\nand our old clothes, to his family. And when I didn\\'t finish my dinner,\\nmy mother would say, \"Finish your food! Don\\'t you know?\\nPeople like Fide\\'s family have nothing.\" So I felt enormous pity for Fide\\'s family. Then one Saturday,\\nwe went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us\\na beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia\\nthat his brother had made. I was startled. It had not occurred to me\\nthat anybody in his family could actually make something. All I had heard about them\\nwas how poor they were, so that it had become impossible for me\\nto see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my single story of them. Years later, I thought about this\\nwhen I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States. I was 19. My American roommate was shocked by me. She asked where I had learned\\nto speak English so well, and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English\\nas its official language. She asked if she could listen\\nto what she called my \"tribal music,\" and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey. (Laughter) She assumed that I did not know\\nhow to use a stove. What struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me\\neven before she saw me. Her default position\\ntoward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing,\\nwell-meaning pity. My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no possibility of Africans\\nbeing similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings\\nmore complex than pity, no possibility of a connection\\nas human equals. I must say that before I went to the U.S., I didn\\'t consciously identify as African. But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,\\npeople turned to me. Never mind that I knew nothing\\nabout places like Namibia. But I did come to embrace\\nthis new identity, and in many ways I think\\nof myself now as African. Although I still get quite irritable\\nwhen Africa is referred to as a country, the most recent example being\\nmy otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago, in which there was an announcement\\non the Virgin flight about the charity work in \"India,\\nAfrica and other countries.\" (Laughter) So, after I had spent some years\\nin the U.S. as an African, I began to understand\\nmy roommate\\'s response to me. If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa\\nwere from popular images, I too would think that Africa\\nwas a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars,\\ndying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved\\nby a kind, white foreigner. I would see Africans\\nin the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide\\'s family. This single story of Africa ultimately\\ncomes, I think, from Western literature. Now, here is a quote from the writing\\nof a London merchant called John Lok, who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating\\naccount of his voyage. After referring to the black Africans\\nas \"beasts who have no houses,\" he writes, \"They are also\\npeople without heads, having their mouth and eyes\\nin their breasts.\" Now, I\\'ve laughed\\nevery time I\\'ve read this. And one must admire\\nthe imagination of John Lok. But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling\\nAfrican stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa\\nas a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words\\nof the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are \"half devil, half child.\" And so, I began to realize\\nthat my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions\\nof this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novel\\nwas not \"authentically African.\" Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things\\nwrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined\\nthat it had failed at achieving something\\ncalled African authenticity. In fact, I did not know\\nwhat African authenticity was. The professor told me that my characters\\nwere too much like him, an educated and middle-class man. My characters drove cars. They were not starving. Therefore they were not\\nauthentically African. But I must quickly add\\nthat I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story. A few years ago,\\nI visited Mexico from the U.S. The political climate in the U.S.\\nat the time was tense, and there were debates going on\\nabout immigration. And, as often happens in America, immigration became\\nsynonymous with Mexicans. There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were\\nfleecing the healthcare system, sneaking across the border, being arrested at the border,\\nthat sort of thing. I remember walking around\\non my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise. And then, I was overwhelmed with shame. I realized that I had been so immersed\\nin the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind, the abject immigrant. I had bought into\\nthe single story of Mexicans and I could not have\\nbeen more ashamed of myself. So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become. It is impossible to talk\\nabout the single story without talking about power. There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about\\nthe power structures of the world, and it is \"nkali.\" It\\'s a noun that loosely translates\\nto \"to be greater than another.\" Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined\\nby the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they\\'re told,\\nhow many stories are told, are really dependent on power. Power is the ability not just to tell\\nthe story of another person, but to make it the definitive\\nstory of that person. The Palestinian poet\\nMourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it\\nis to tell their story and to start with, \"secondly.\" Start the story with the arrows\\nof the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with\\nthe failure of the African state, and not with the colonial\\ncreation of the African state, and you have an entirely different story. I recently spoke at a university where a student told me\\nthat it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him that I had just read a novel\\ncalled \"American Psycho\" -- (Laughter) -- and that it was such a shame that young Americans\\nwere serial murderers. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, obviously I said this\\nin a fit of mild irritation. (Laughter) But it would never have\\noccurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel\\nin which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow\\nrepresentative of all Americans. This is not because I am\\na better person than that student, but because of America\\'s cultural\\nand economic power, I had many stories of America. I had read Tyler and Updike\\nand Steinbeck and Gaitskill. I did not have a single story of America. When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected\\nto have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent\\nhorrible things my parents had done to me. (Laughter) But the truth is that I had\\na very happy childhood, full of laughter and love,\\nin a very close-knit family. But I also had grandfathers\\nwho died in refugee camps. My cousin Polle died because\\nhe could not get adequate healthcare. One of my closest friends,\\nOkoloma, died in a plane crash because our fire trucks\\ndid not have water. I grew up under repressive\\nmilitary governments that devalued education, so that sometimes, my parents\\nwere not paid their salaries. And so, as a child, I saw jam\\ndisappear from the breakfast table, then margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became rationed. And most of all, a kind\\nof normalized political fear invaded our lives. All of these stories make me who I am. But to insist on only\\nthese negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other\\nstories that formed me. The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes\\nis not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story. Of course, Africa is a continent\\nfull of catastrophes: There are immense ones,\\nsuch as the horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones, such as the fact that 5,000 people apply\\nfor one job vacancy in Nigeria. But there are other stories\\nthat are not about catastrophe, and it is very important, it is just\\nas important, to talk about them. I\\'ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly\\nwith a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories\\nof that place and that person. The consequence\\nof the single story is this: It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition\\nof our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different\\nrather than how we are similar. So what if before my Mexican trip, I had followed the immigration\\ndebate from both sides, the U.S. and the Mexican? What if my mother had told us\\nthat Fide\\'s family was poor and hardworking? What if we had an African\\ntelevision network that broadcast diverse\\nAfrican stories all over the world? What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe\\ncalls \"a balance of stories.\" What if my roommate knew\\nabout my Nigerian publisher, Muhtar Bakare, a remarkable man who left\\nhis job in a bank to follow his dream\\nand start a publishing house? Now, the conventional wisdom\\nwas that Nigerians don\\'t read literature. He disagreed. He felt that people\\nwho could read, would read, if you made literature affordable\\nand available to them. Shortly after he published my first novel, I went to a TV station\\nin Lagos to do an interview, and a woman who worked there\\nas a messenger came up to me and said, \"I really liked your novel.\\nI didn\\'t like the ending. Now, you must write a sequel,\\nand this is what will happen ...\" (Laughter) And she went on to tell me\\nwhat to write in the sequel. I was not only charmed, I was very moved. Here was a woman, part of the ordinary\\nmasses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers. She had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me\\nwhat to write in the sequel. Now, what if my roommate knew\\nabout my friend Funmi Iyanda, a fearless woman who hosts\\na TV show in Lagos, and is determined to tell the stories\\nthat we prefer to forget? What if my roommate knew\\nabout the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos\\nhospital last week? What if my roommate knew\\nabout contemporary Nigerian music, talented people singing\\nin English and Pidgin, and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo, mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers. What if my roommate knew\\nabout the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria\\nto challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get\\ntheir husband\\'s consent before renewing their passports? What if my roommate knew about Nollywood, full of innovative people making\\nfilms despite great technical odds, films so popular that they really are the best example\\nof Nigerians consuming what they produce? What if my roommate knew about\\nmy wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business\\nselling hair extensions? Or about the millions of other Nigerians\\nwho start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse ambition? Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation\\nfor most Nigerians: our failed infrastructure,\\nour failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive\\ndespite the government, rather than because of it. I teach writing workshops\\nin Lagos every summer, and it is amazing to me\\nhow many people apply, how many people are eager to write, to tell stories. My Nigerian publisher and I\\nhave just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust, and we have big dreams\\nof building libraries and refurbishing libraries\\nthat already exist and providing books for state schools that don\\'t have anything\\nin their libraries, and also of organizing lots\\nand lots of workshops, in reading and writing, for all the people who are eager\\nto tell our many stories. Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used\\nto dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used\\nto empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair\\nthat broken dignity. The American writer\\nAlice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives\\nwho had moved to the North. She introduced them to a book about the Southern life\\nthat they had left behind. \"They sat around,\\nreading the book themselves, listening to me read the book,\\nand a kind of paradise was regained.\" I would like to end with this thought: That when we reject the single story, when we realize that\\nthere is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Translator: Leonardo Silva\\nReviewer: David DeRuwe Have you ever worked with people\\nwho are not as good as they think? (Laughter) I know this will surprise you,\\nbut statistically, they are more likely\\nto be male than female. (Laughter) That\\'s right. Men are typically more deceived\\nabout their talents than women are. They are also more likely\\nto succeed in their careers. That\\'s because one of the best ways to fool other people into thinking\\nthat you\\'re better than you actually are is to fool yourself first. (Laughter) This is why you may not\\njust have worked with people who are not as good as they think,\\nbut also for them. Unfortunately, being unaware\\nof your limitations increases your probability\\nof being a boss. (Laughter) I\\'m an organizational psychologist. I use science and technology to predict\\nand understand human behavior at work. One of the areas that fascinates me is the relationship between\\ngender, personality and leadership; more specifically,\\nhow gender and personality shape our choices of leaders and how those leaders\\nthen impact organizations. Discussions on gender tend to focus on the under-representation\\nof women in leadership, which is more or less universal. Anywhere in the world -\\nwell, outside Iceland perhaps - the vast majority of leaders are male. But a bigger problem is the fact that\\nmost of these leaders are incompetent. Indeed, whether in business or politics, most leaders have very negative effects\\non their followers and subordinates, causing low levels of engagement,\\ntrust and productivity, and high levels of burnout and stress. Just google \"my boss is\" to see what most people think\\nof their managers - (Laughter) and maybe, just maybe,\\nfeel a bit better about your manager: (Laughter) \"Crazy,\" \"abusive,\" \"unbearable,\" \"toxic,\" and some other things\\nthat are just too rude to repeat here. So the main question we should be asking is not why there aren\\'t\\nany more women leaders, but why so many incompetent\\nmen become leaders. My research suggests\\nthere are three main reasons for this. The first is our inability to distinguish\\nbetween confidence and competence. Anywhere in the world, we assume that confident people\\nhave more potential for leadership, but in any area of talent,\\nincluding leadership, there\\'s just very little overlap\\nbetween confidence - how good people think\\nthey are at something - and competence - how good\\nthey actually are at something. I grew up in Argentina where the gap between confidence\\nand competence is particularly pronounced. (Laughter) In fact, one of the best investments\\nyou can make in your life is to buy an Argentine for what he\\'s worth and sell him for what\\nhe thinks he is worth. (Laughter) As you can imagine,\\nI can\\'t crack this joke back home. (Laughter) We\\'re just not self-aware\\nenough to find it funny. (Laughter) Unfortunately, though, most leaders have\\nsomething Argentine in them, in that their self-perceived talents\\ntend to surpass their actual talents. The second reason is our love\\nfor charismatic individuals, particularly since the 1960s\\nmass media explosion - but this has been turbocharged\\nby the recent digital age. We appear to want leaders\\nwho are charming and entertaining, but there is a big difference between an effective leader\\nand a stand-up comedian. (Laughter) In fact, the best leaders are humble\\nrather than charismatic, to the point of even being rather boring. This is why they rarely feature\\nin the media or blockbuster movies. For example, imagine a movie\\non Angela Merkel. (Laughter) She wakes up, has breakfast with her husband, goes to meetings well-prepared, lets other people talk\\nwithout interrupting them, (Laughter) makes rational decisions, runs her country well, there are no scandals about her. In contrast, there is a surplus\\nof captivating biopics on charismatic leaders\\nwith a fascinating dark side, who end up ruining their countries\\nand organizations. The third and final reason\\nfor the rise of incompetent men is our inability to resist\\nthe allure of narcissistic individuals, people with grandiose\\nand megalomaniac visions that tap into our own narcissism. We\\'ve always admired famous people, but our admiration for people\\nwho admire themselves or are famous for, well,\\njust being famous, has been rising for decades. At this rate, future generations\\nwill look back at Kim and Kanye and say, \"Whoa! Weren\\'t they modest?\" (Laughter) Remember Paris Hilton? Exactly; she\\'s hardly newsworthy today. In line, much of the popular advice that focuses on helping\\npeople become leaders nurtures and promotes\\na narcissistic mindset: \"Love yourself, no matter what!\" \"Don\\'t worry about\\nwhat people think of you. If you think you\\'re great, you are!\" Unfortunately, this creates\\na surplus of leaders who are unaware of their limitations\\nand unjustifiably pleased with themselves. They see leadership as an entitlement\\nand lack empathy and self-control, so they end up acting without integrity\\nand indulging in reckless risks. In contrast, the best leaders manage\\nto keep their narcissism in check. They care a lot about other people,\\nincluding what they think of them, and spend a great deal of time\\nworrying about their reputation, which is why there are\\nvery few scandals about them. So, how then do we stop\\nincompetent men from becoming leaders? The first solution is to follow the signs and look for the qualities\\nthat make people better leaders, especially when they don\\'t usually\\nmake people leaders. There is a pathological mismatch between the attributes\\nthat seduce us in a leader and those that are needed\\nto be an effective leader. If we want to improve\\nthe performance of our leaders, we should start by focusing\\non the right traits. Instead of falling for people who are\\nconfident, narcissistic and charismatic, we should promote people into leadership because of their competence,\\nhumility and integrity. Incidentally, this - (Applause) this would also lead to a higher proportion\\nof female than male leaders - (Applause) (Cheers) as large-scale scientific studies show\\nthat women score higher than men on measures of competence,\\nhumility and integrity. But the point is that we would significantly improve\\nthe quality of our leaders. The second solution\\nis to distrust our instincts. Most of us love our intuition, but most people are\\njust not as intuitive as they think. In that sense, intuition\\nis a bit like sense of humor. Ninety percent of people think\\nthey have a fantastic sense of humor. How many people are actually funny? Ten percent? One implication is to focus less on the impressions people make\\nduring job or media interviews, which are just an invitation\\nto project our own biases and prejudices. Note that even when\\nwe have good intentions, it is not easy to overcome this. For example, unconscious bias training\\nwill rarely help you ignore that the person in front of you\\nis white, female or attractive. In fact, the more you try to suppress\\ncertain thoughts from your mind, the more prominent\\nand present they become. So, the last thing we should be doing, if we want to improve\\nthe quality of our leaders and help more women\\nget to leadership positions, is to not lower our standards\\nwhen we select women, but to elevate them\\nwhen we select male leaders. This means not asking women\\nto behave more like incompetent men. For example - For example - (Cheers) (Applause) asking them to lean in even when they don\\'t have\\nthe talents to back it up, or spend more time on self-promotion\\nor advancing their own personal interests. It also means not ruling out men because they lack\\nthe traditional masculine features that match our flawed\\nleadership archetypes. To the extent that we can do this,\\nwe will end up with better leaders, but progress starts\\nwith each and every one of us. If we want to improve\\nthe competence level of our leaders, we should first improve\\nour own competence for judging and selecting leaders, especially when they\\'re men. Thank you. (Cheers) (Applause)', 'Translator: Taylor Busacca\\nReviewer: Riaki Poništ Imagine waking up one day and realizing that you were born\\non a completely different planet, and everything you learnt was a lie, and your country\\'s history\\nwas so fabricated, and everyone around you\\nwas so brainwashed, and heroes you worship\\nwere actually monstrous villains. This is like a plot\\nto a science fiction novel, but it\\'s the insane reality \\nfor North Koreans like me. From the moment I was born, I was indoctorated to worship \\nour first dictator Kim Il-Sung. And I always bowed to his pictures\\nwhich hang in every North Korean\\'s home. To us, he was Santa Clause and God, who was delivering presents on holidays\\nand performing numerous miracles. When he was fighting our enemy, he made bombs from pine cones and turned sand into rice and crossed a river on tree leaves, and he even crossed the rainbow. So that\\'s why when I was young, I used to believe that I could also\\ncross the rainbow. With only one source of propaganda and no access to outside information, I was totally ignorant. This is a really good thing,\\nto live in North Korea, because the regime imposes the deadly mix of ignorance and fears so even if you wanted to wake up\\nfrom your Orwellian nightmare, you intentionally put\\nyourself back to sleep. If you don\\'t, your entire family, or sometimes three generations of family, will be sent to a political prison camp\\nin the middle of the night, where starvation and torture are standard. This is what happened\\nto my friend\\'s father, who simply said to his best friend,\\n\"The system is unfair.\" That\\'s why my mom told me always,\\neven when I was young, to be careful. \"The birds hear you by day, and the mice hear you at night,\" she said. We found safety in our ignorance, and we believed everything\\nthat the regime told us. Especially, we believed the outside world\\nwas miserable and dangerous. I respected the dear leader,\\nKim Il-Sung, for protecting us from the American imperialists, who enslave South Koreans\\nin the horrible capitalist hell, even today. We also believed that in the capitalist countries,\\nlike South Korea and America, so many people die outside hospitals\\nbecause they can\\'t pay. So we were extremely grateful to be living in our Communist utopia. Well, from the famine in the mid-1990s, I saw something different\\nthat doesn\\'t make sense. People were starving to death,\\nand I thought to myself, \"How can our wonderful\\nCommunist system allow this to happen?\" Those began to fill my mind as beggars and dead bodies\\nfilled the street, and I had goosebumps\\nwhen I walked home from school, and I sometimes smelled\\nthe decomposing flesh. But it wasn\\'t until I started watching\\nillegal Chinese TV at night, in my little secret world\\nunder the blanket, I began to understand the truth\\nabout North Korea in the outside world. I couldn\\'t imagine what I was watching on Chinese TV, because I\\'d never seen\\nthe products advertised on TV and the characters\\nwith dyed hair and ripped chins, and living in a bright\\nand modern new world. So, I realized North Korea\\nwas not a paradise. My family had really good relationships\\nwith the border guys, so one of them helped me\\nto cross the border into China. Full of curiosity and attraction\\nabout the new world. I decided to take on another\\nbolder steps to cross the border to find out the truth. And it changed my life forever. After arriving in China, I never thought I could return\\nto my homelands due to the rumors of my escape, so I would constantly change my name, hunted by the Chinese\\nauthorities all the time. That\\'s why I became\\nthe Girl with Seven Names. The brilliant new world in China wasn\\'t for North Korean defectors. It wasn\\'t for me. So I was hiding in fear and isolation, but I did my best to learn\\nmore about my country, and I was stunned to find that all the history\\nwas horrible propaganda and especially South Korea\\'s economy\\nwas much ahead of North Korea, which we were brainwashed to believe South Korea was a terribly poor country. And most importantly, I realized that a life of fear,\\nhunger, and oppression, is a crime against\\nthe North Korean people. I really wanted to experience the half\\nof the divided Korean Peninsula, so in the end, I made\\nanother big decision again by taking a flight\\nfrom China to South Korea. Even though I was flying South,\\nback to the land of Korean people, I felt like I was flying farther\\nand farther from my family. And when I landed, I thought about the DMZ\\ndividing the Korean Peninsula, and I was asking myself, \"Am I going to be separated\\nfrom my family forever?\" At the airport I was so hopeful\\nwhen I asked for asylum, but I received a rude\\nintroduction to South Korea. The two officials checked\\nmy phoney Chinese passport and Visa, and they asked me with suspicious eyes, \"These are real. Are you really a North Korean defector?\" They thought I was Chinese citizen trying to receive\\na South Korean citizenship. So, they told me to go back\\nto China on the next flight, or else I would receive\\nstrict punishment under the law, and then be deported. My life flashed before my eyes. I couldn\\'t believe, even in South Korea, I was in danger of being deported\\nto China and then back to North Korea, where I would be tortured and publicly executed\\nfor visiting the South. I almost had a breakdown. At the long interrogation, I had to still convince\\nthe South Korean authorities that I wasn\\'t a North Korean spy\\nor a Chinese citizen. It\\'s ironic that while I was hiding\\nin China for many years, I had to convince the Chinese authorities\\nthat I wasn\\'t a North Korean defector. Now I had to do my best to convince\\nthe South Korean authorities that I actually was\\na North Korean defector. And then in 2009, I returned to the border\\nbetween North Korea and China, and arranged a route \\nfor my my family to escape. My family all walked\\nacross freezing water under the seven\\nborder guarders\\' protection, because they were friends, but we were almost caught\\nin China several times. Within the first five minutes of departure a Chinese military soldier\\ngot on the bus and started checking IDs. My family couldn\\'t speak Chinese,\\nso we would be easily exposed. As the soldier approached, my brother\\'s face turned so dark,\\nlike he was going to die. So I quickly jumped in the aisle\\nin front of the soldier, and I started taking pictures\\nof his face to distract him. He screamed at me, I apologized, and in the end,\\nhe ran off the bus in anger. Amazingly we survived\\nthe 2,000 km across China, but in the end my family\\nwent through hell in Laos, after being imprisoned twice. I was so devastated to see\\nmy mother\\'s frail body and bony face when I came to get her out the prison. After 14 years of long separation, we could finally be reunited\\nin South Korea in 2010. But after even we found real freedom, I realized that we can never be free\\nfrom the North Korean regime, because the leadership\\nbecame increasingly angry, like defectors like me, we\\'re were sharing\\nour stories with the world, and then telling the truth\\nabout the human rights overseas which made the United Nations\\'\\nlandmark COI report last year. So the regime fought back by making\\na propaganda videos against defectors. They featured North Korean relatives,\\nback in North Korea, Revealing the huge rift and mental anguish for those of us who speak out. At the same time, the regime\\nalso was struggling to fight two of the biggest\\nthreats to its existence: information flowing in\\nand people flowing out. The external information, especially South Korean dramas and movies that have made South Korea\\nso popular among the North Korean people and shattered the propaganda\\nabout the regime\\'s superiority. So in response, the regime enhanced the border\\'s\\nsecurity situation to prevent defections, and the propagandists brought\\na surprising solution, the Defector Press Conference, which featured North Koreans who actually first escaped to South Korea but then returned to North Korea later. In the Defector Press Conference, the returning defectors told similar\\nstories about their defection, like South Korean intelligence agent\\ntricked them into defecting, so they suffered miserable\\nlives in capitalist societies, so they dreamed to return to North Korea, and ultimately the supreme leader,\\nKim Jung-un, welcomed them back home despite their betrayal. But there\\'s evidence that these defectors\\nwere actually forced by the regime to return and give the press conference. But it\\'s tragic that actually\\nNorth Korean defectors are suffering in South Korea even though we sacrificed\\neverything to reach freedom. When we finally find it, we are still suffering\\nwith many different reasons and confronted by the North Korean regime. We are on the front lines of the battle\\nagainst the North Korean tyranny, the regime\\'s tyranny,\\nby the human rights offices, and we are winning thanks to many of you\\nwho fight by our side. And to anyone who wants\\nto join in our fight please share our story widely, so the whole world\\nwill know about the truth in my country, North Korea. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Hi. Let me ask the audience a question: Did you ever lie as a child? If you did, could you please\\nraise your hand? Wow! This is the most honest\\ngroup of people I\\'ve ever met. (Laughter) So for the last 20 years, I\\'ve been studying\\nhow children learn to tell lies. And today, I\\'m going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made. But to begin, I\\'m going to tell you\\na story from Mr. Richard Messina, who is my friend and an elementary\\nschool principal. He got a phone call one day. The caller says, \"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny\\nwill not come to school today because he\\'s sick.\" Mr. Messina asks, \"Who am I speaking to, please?\" And the caller says, \"I am my father.\" (Laughter) So this story -- (Laughter) sums up very nicely\\nthree common beliefs we have about children and lying. One, children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school. Two, children are poor liars. We adults can easily detect their lies. And three, if children lie\\nat a very young age, there must be some\\ncharacter flaws with them, and they are going to become\\npathological liars for life. Well, it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong. We have been playing guessing games with children all over the world. Here is an example. So in this game, we asked children\\nto guess the numbers on the cards. And we tell them if they win the game, they are going to get a big prize. But in the middle of the game, we make an excuse and leave the room. And before we leave the room, we tell them not to peek at the cards. Of course, we have hidden cameras in the room to watch their every move. Because the desire\\nto win the game is so strong, more than 90 percent of children will peek as soon as we leave the room. (Laughter) The crucial question is: When we return and ask the children whether or not they have peeked, will the children who peeked confess or lie about their transgression? We found that regardless\\nof gender, country, religion, at two years of age, 30 percent lie, 70 percent tell the truth\\nabout their transgression. At three years of age, 50 percent lie and 50 percent\\ntell the truth. At four years of age, more than 80 percent lie. And after four years of age, most children lie. So as you can see, lying is really a typical part\\nof development. And some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age. So now, let\\'s take a closer look\\nat the younger children. Why do some but not all\\nyoung children lie? In cooking, you need good ingredients to cook good food. And good lying requires\\ntwo key ingredients. The first key ingredient\\nis theory of mind, or the mind-reading ability. Mind reading is the ability to know that different people have\\ndifferent knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate\\nbetween what I know and what you know. Mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that I know you don\\'t know what I know. Therefore, I can lie to you. The second key ingredient\\nfor good lying is self-control. It is the ability to control your speech,\\nyour facial expression and your body language, so that you can tell a convincing lie. And we found that those young children who have more advanced mind-reading\\nand self-control abilities tell lies earlier and are more sophisticated liars. As it turns out, these two abilities\\nare also essential for all of us to function well in our society. In fact, deficits in mind-reading\\nand self-control abilities are associated with serious\\ndevelopmental problems, such as ADHD and autism. So if you discover your two-year-old\\nis telling his or her first lie, instead of being alarmed, you should celebrate -- (Laughter) because it signals that your child\\nhas arrived at a new milestone of typical development. Now, are children poor liars? Do you think you can easily\\ndetect their lies? Would you like to give it a try? Yes? OK. So I\\'m going to show you two videos. In the videos, the children are going to respond\\nto a researcher\\'s question, \"Did you peek?\" So try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth. Here\\'s child number one. Are you ready? (Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No. Kang Lee: And this is child number two. (Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No. KL: OK, if you think\\nchild number one is lying, please raise your hand. And if you think child number two\\nis lying, please raise your hand. OK, so as a matter of fact, child number one is telling the truth, child number two is lying. Looks like many of you are terrible\\ndetectors of children\\'s lies. (Laughter) Now, we have played similar kinds of games with many, many adults\\nfrom all walks of life. And we show them many videos. In half of the videos, the children lied. In the other half of the videos,\\nthe children told the truth. And let\\'s find out\\nhow these adults performed. Because there are as many liars\\nas truth tellers, if you guess randomly, there\\'s a 50 percent chance\\nyou\\'re going to get it right. So if your accuracy is around 50 percent, it means you are a terrible detector\\nof children\\'s lies. So let\\'s start with undergrads\\nand law school students, who typically have\\nlimited experience with children. No, they cannot detect children\\'s lies. Their performance is around chance. Now how about social workers\\nand child-protection lawyers, who work with children on a daily basis? Can they detect children\\'s lies? No, they cannot. (Laughter) What about judges, customs officers and police officers, who deal with liars on a daily basis? Can they detect children\\'s lies? No, they cannot. What about parents? Can parents detect other children\\'s lies? No, they cannot. What about, can parents\\ndetect their own children\\'s lies? No, they cannot. (Laughter) (Applause) So now you may ask why children\\'s lies\\nare so difficult to detect. Let me illustrate this\\nwith my own son, Nathan. This is his facial expression when he lies. (Laughter) So when children lie, their facial expression\\nis typically neutral. However, behind this neutral expression, the child is actually experiencing\\na lot of emotions, such as fear, guilt, shame and maybe a little bit of liar\\'s delight. (Laughter) Unfortunately, such emotions\\nare either fleeting or hidden. Therefore, it\\'s mostly invisible to us. So in the last five years, we have been trying to figure out a way\\nto reveal these hidden emotions. Then we made a discovery. We know that underneath our facial skin, there\\'s a rich network of blood vessels. When we experience different emotions, our facial blood flow changes subtly. And these changes are regulated\\nby the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control. By looking at facial blood flow changes, we can reveal people\\'s hidden emotions. Unfortunately, such emotion-related\\nfacial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye. So to help us reveal\\npeople\\'s facial emotions, we have developed a new imaging technology we call \"transdermal optical imaging.\" To do so, we use a regular\\nvideo camera to record people when they experience\\nvarious hidden emotions. And then, using our image\\nprocessing technology, we can extract transdermal images\\nof facial blood flow changes. By looking at transdermal video images, now we can easily see facial blood flow changes associated\\nwith the various hidden emotions. And using this technology, we can now reveal the hidden emotions\\nassociated with lying, and therefore detect people\\'s lies. We can do so noninvasively, remotely, inexpensively, with an accuracy at about 85 percent, which is far better than chance level. And in addition, we discovered\\na Pinocchio effect. No, not this Pinocchio effect. (Laughter) This is the real Pinocchio effect. When people lie, the facial blood flow\\non the cheeks decreases, and the facial blood flow\\non the nose increases. Of course, lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions. So then we asked ourselves, in addition to detecting lies, how can our technology be used? One application is in education. For example, using this technology,\\nwe can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience high anxiety\\nabout the topic he\\'s teaching so that he can help him. And also we can use this in health care. For example, every day I Skype my parents, who live thousands of miles away. And using this technology, I can not only find out\\nwhat\\'s going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor\\ntheir heart rate, their stress level, their mood and whether or not\\nthey are experiencing pain. And perhaps in the future, their risks for heart attack\\nor hypertension. And you may ask: Can we use this also to reveal\\npoliticians\\' emotions? (Laughter) For example, during a debate. Well, the answer is yes. Using TV footage, we could detect\\nthe politicians\\' heart rate, mood and stress, and perhaps in the future,\\nwhether or not they are lying to us. We can also use this\\nin marketing research, for example, to find out whether or not people like\\ncertain consumer products. We can even use it in dating. So for example, if your date is smiling at you, this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you. And in this case, she is just trying to be nice to you. (Laughter) So transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development. Many new applications will come about\\nthat we don\\'t know today. However, one thing I know for sure is that lying will never\\nbe the same again. Thank you very much. Xiè xie. (Applause)', 'When I was six years old, I received my gifts. My first grade teacher\\nhad this brilliant idea. She wanted us to experience\\nreceiving gifts but also learning the virtue\\nof complimenting each other. So she had all of us\\ncome to the front of the classroom, and she bought all of us gifts\\nand stacked them in the corner. And she said, \"Why don\\'t we just stand here\\nand compliment each other? If you hear your name called, go and pick up your gift and sit down.\" What a wonderful idea, right? What could go wrong? (Laughter) Well, there were 40 of us to start with, and every time I heard\\nsomeone\\'s name called, I would give out the heartiest cheer. And then there were 20 people left, and 10 people left, and five left ... and three left. And I was one of them. And the compliments stopped. Well, at that moment, I was crying. And the teacher was freaking out. She was like, \"Hey, would anyone\\nsay anything nice about these people?\" (Laughter) \"No one? OK, why don\\'t you\\ngo get your gift and sit down. So behave next year -- someone might say\\nsomething nice about you.\" (Laughter) Well, as I\\'m describing this you, you probably know\\nI remember this really well. (Laughter) But I don\\'t know who felt worse that day. Was it me or the teacher? She must have realized\\nthat she turned a team-building event into a public roast\\nfor three six-year-olds. And without the humor. You know, when you see\\npeople get roasted on TV, it was funny. There was nothing funny about that day. So that was one version of me, and I would die to avoid\\nbeing in that situation again -- to get rejected in public again. That\\'s one version. Then fast-forward eight years. Bill Gates came to my hometown -- Beijing, China -- to speak, and I saw his message. I fell in love with that guy. I thought, wow,\\nI know what I want to do now. That night I wrote a letter to my family telling them: \"By age 25, I will build the biggest\\ncompany in the world, and that company will buy Microsoft.\" (Laughter) I totally embraced this idea\\nof conquering the world -- domination, right? And I didn\\'t make this up,\\nI did write that letter. And here it is -- (Laughter) You don\\'t have to read this through -- (Laughter) This is also bad handwriting,\\nbut I did highlight some key words. You get the idea. (Laughter) So ... that was another version of me: one who will conquer the world. Well, then two years later, I was presented with the opportunity\\nto come to the United States. I jumped on it, because that was\\nwhere Bill Gates lived, right? (Laughter) I thought that was the start\\nof my entrepreneur journey. Then, fast-forward another 14 years. I was 30. Nope, I didn\\'t build that company. I didn\\'t even start. I was actually a marketing manager\\nfor a Fortune 500 company. And I felt I was stuck; I was stagnant. Why is that? Where is that 14-year-old\\nwho wrote that letter? It\\'s not because he didn\\'t try. It\\'s because every time I had a new idea, every time I wanted to try something new, even at work -- I wanted to make a proposal, I wanted to speak up\\nin front of people in a group -- I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old\\nand the six-year-old. One wanted to conquer the world -- make a difference -- another was afraid of rejection. And every time that six-year-old won. And this fear even persisted\\nafter I started my own company. I mean, I started\\nmy own company when I was 30 -- if you want to be Bill Gates, you\\'ve got to start\\nsooner or later, right? When I was an entrepreneur, I was presented\\nwith an investment opportunity, and then I was turned down. And that rejection hurt me. It hurt me so bad\\nthat I wanted to quit right there. But then I thought, hey, would Bill Gates quit\\nafter a simple investment rejection? Would any successful\\nentrepreneur quit like that? No way. And this is where it clicked for me. OK, I can build a better company. I can build a better\\nteam or better product, but one thing for sure: I\\'ve got to be a better leader. I\\'ve got to be a better person. I cannot let that six-year-old\\nkeep dictating my life anymore. I have to put him back in his place. So this is where I went online\\nand looked for help. Google was my friend. (Laughter) I searched, \"How do I overcome\\nthe fear of rejection?\" I came up with a bunch\\nof psychology articles about where the fear\\nand pain are coming from. Then I came up with a bunch\\nof \"rah-rah\" inspirational articles about \"Don\\'t take it personally,\\njust overcome it.\" Who doesn\\'t know that? (Laughter) But why was I still so scared? Then I found this website by luck. It\\'s called rejectiontherapy.com. (Laughter) \"Rejection Therapy\" was this game\\ninvented by this Canadian entrepreneur. His name is Jason Comely. And basically the idea is for 30 days\\nyou go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end,\\nyou desensitize yourself from the pain. And I loved that idea. (Laughter) I said, \"You know what?\\nI\\'m going to do this. And I\\'ll feel myself\\ngetting rejected 100 days.\" And I came up with my own rejection ideas, and I made a video blog out of it. And so here\\'s what I did. This is what the blog looked like. Day One ... (Laughter) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger. So this is where I went\\nto where I was working. I came downstairs and I saw this big guy\\nsitting behind a desk. He looked like a security guard. So I just approached him. And I was just walking and that was the longest\\nwalk of my life -- hair on the back\\nof my neck standing up, I was sweating and my heart was pounding. And I got there and said, \"Hey, sir, can I borrow\\n100 dollars from you?\" (Laughter) And he looked up, he\\'s like, \"No.\" \"Why?\" And I just said, \"No? I\\'m sorry.\" Then I turned around,\\nand I just ran. (Laughter) I felt so embarrassed. But because I filmed myself -- so that night I was watching\\nmyself getting rejected, I just saw how scared I was. I looked like this kid\\nin \"The Sixth Sense.\" I saw dead people. (Laughter) But then I saw this guy. You know, he wasn\\'t that menacing. He was a chubby, loveable guy, and he even asked me, \"Why?\" In fact, he invited me to explain myself. And I could\\'ve said many things. I could\\'ve explained,\\nI could\\'ve negotiated. I didn\\'t do any of that. All I did was run. I felt, wow, this is like\\na microcosm of my life. Every time I felt the slightest rejection, I would just run as fast as I could. And you know what? The next day, no matter what happens, I\\'m not going to run. I\\'ll stay engaged. Day Two: Request a \"burger refill.\" (Laughter) It\\'s when I went to a burger joint, I finished lunch,\\nand I went to the cashier and said, \"Hi, can I get a burger refill?\" (Laughter) He was all confused,\\nlike, \"What\\'s a burger refill?\" (Laughter) I said, \"Well, it\\'s just like\\na drink refill but with a burger.\" And he said, \"Sorry,\\nwe don\\'t do burger refill, man.\" (Laughter) So this is where rejection happened\\nand I could have run, but I stayed. I said, \"Well, I love your burgers, I love your joint, and if you guys do a burger refill, I will love you guys more.\" (Laughter) And he said, \"Well, OK,\\nI\\'ll tell my manager about it, and maybe we\\'ll do it,\\nbut sorry, we can\\'t do this today.\" Then I left. And by the way, I don\\'t think they\\'ve\\never done burger refill. (Laughter) I think they\\'re still there. But the life and death feeling\\nI was feeling the first time was no longer there, just because I stayed engaged -- because I didn\\'t run. I said, \"Wow, great,\\nI\\'m already learning things. Great.\" And then Day Three:\\nGetting Olympic Doughnuts. This is where my life\\nwas turned upside down. I went to a Krispy Kreme. It\\'s a doughnut shop in mainly the Southeastern part\\nof the United States. I\\'m sure they have some here, too. And I went in, I said, \"Can you make me doughnuts\\nthat look like Olympic symbols? Basically, you interlink\\nfive doughnuts together ... \" I mean there\\'s no way\\nthey could say yes, right? The doughnut maker took me so seriously. (Laughter) So she put out paper, started jotting down\\nthe colors and the rings, and is like, \"How can I make this?\" And then 15 minutes later, she came out with a box\\nthat looked like Olympic rings. And I was so touched. I just couldn\\'t believe it. And that video got\\nover five million views on Youtube. The world couldn\\'t believe that either. (Laughter) You know, because of that\\nI was in newspapers, in talk shows, in everything. And I became famous. A lot of people\\nstarted writing emails to me and saying, \"What you\\'re\\ndoing is awesome.\" But you know, fame and notoriety\\ndid not do anything to me. What I really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself. So I turned the rest\\nof my 100 days of rejection into this playground -- into this research project. I wanted to see what I could learn. And then I learned a lot of things. I discovered so many secrets. For example, I found if I just don\\'t run, if I got rejected, I could actually turn a \"no\" into a \"yes,\" and the magic word is, \"why.\" So one day I went to a stranger\\'s house,\\nI had this flower in my hand, knocked on the door and said, \"Hey, can I plant this flower\\nin your backyard?\" (Laughter) And he said, \"No.\" But before he could leave I said, \"Hey, can I know why?\" And he said, \"Well, I have this dog that would dig up\\nanything I put in the backyard. I don\\'t want to waste your flower. If you want to do this,\\ngo across the street and talk to Connie. She loves flowers.\" So that\\'s what I did. I went across and knocked\\non Connie\\'s door. And she was so happy to see me. (Laughter) And then half an hour later, there was this flower\\nin Connie\\'s backyard. I\\'m sure it looks better now. (Laughter) But had I left\\nafter the initial rejection, I would\\'ve thought, well, it\\'s because\\nthe guy didn\\'t trust me, it\\'s because I was crazy, because I didn\\'t dress up well,\\nI didn\\'t look good. It was none of those. It was because what I offered\\ndid not fit what he wanted. And he trusted me enough\\nto offer me a referral, using a sales term. I converted a referral. Then one day -- and I also learned that I can\\nactually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes. So for example,\\none day I went to a Starbucks, and asked the manager,\\n\"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?\" He was like, \"What\\'s a Starbucks greeter?\" I said, \"Do you know\\nthose Walmart greeters? You know, those people who say\\n\\'hi\\' to you before you walk in the store, and make sure you\\ndon\\'t steal stuff, basically? I want to give a Walmart experience\\nto Starbucks customers.\" (Laughter) Well, I\\'m not sure\\nthat\\'s a good thing, actually -- Actually, I\\'m pretty sure\\nit\\'s a bad thing. And he was like, \"Oh\" -- yeah, this is how he looked,\\nhis name is Eric -- and he was like, \"I\\'m not sure.\" This is how he was hearing me. \"Not sure.\" Then I ask him, \"Is that weird?\" He\\'s like, \"Yeah, it\\'s really weird, man.\" But as soon as he said that,\\nhis whole demeanor changed. It\\'s as if he\\'s putting\\nall the doubt on the floor. And he said, \"Yeah, you can do this, just don\\'t get too weird.\" (Laughter) So for the next hour\\nI was the Starbucks greeter. I said \"hi\" to every customer\\nthat walked in, and gave them holiday cheers. By the way, I don\\'t know\\nwhat your career trajectory is, don\\'t be a greeter. (Laughter) It was really boring. But then I found I could do this\\nbecause I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\" I mentioned the doubt that he was having. And because I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\",\\nthat means I wasn\\'t weird. That means I was actually\\nthinking just like him, seeing this as a weird thing. And again, and again, I learned that if I mention\\nsome doubt people might have before I ask the question, I gained their trust. People were more likely to say yes to me. And then I learned\\nI could fulfill my life dream ... by asking. You know, I came\\nfrom four generations of teachers, and my grandma has always told me, \"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want, but it\\'d be great\\nif you became a teacher.\" (Laughter) But I wanted to be\\nan entrepreneur, so I didn\\'t. But it has always been my dream\\nto actually teach something. So I said, \"What if I just ask and teach a college class?\" I lived in Austin at the time, so I went to University\\nof Texas at Austin and knocked on professors\\' doors\\nand said, \"Can I teach your class?\" I didn\\'t get anywhere\\nthe first couple of times. But because I didn\\'t run --\\nI kept doing it -- and on the third try\\nthe professor was very impressed. He was like, \"No one\\nhas done this before.\" And I came in prepared\\nwith powerpoints and my lesson. He said, \"Wow, I can use this. Why don\\'t you come back in two months?\\nI\\'ll fit you in my curriculum.\" And two months later\\nI was teaching a class. This is me -- you probably can\\'t see,\\nthis is a bad picture. You know, sometimes you get\\nrejected by lighting, you know? (Laughter) But wow -- when I finished teaching that class,\\nI walked out crying, because I thought I could fulfill my life dream\\njust by simply asking. I used to think I have to accomplish\\nall these things -- have to be a great entrepreneur,\\nor get a PhD to teach -- but no, I just asked, and I could teach. And in that picture,\\nwhich you can\\'t see, I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr. Why? Because in my research I found\\nthat people who really change the world, who change the way we live\\nand the way we think, are the people who were met\\nwith initial and often violent rejections. People like Martin Luther King, Jr., like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, or even Jesus Christ. These people did not\\nlet rejection define them. They let their own reaction\\nafter rejection define themselves. And they embraced rejection. And we don\\'t have to be those people\\nto learn about rejection, and in my case, rejection was my curse, was my boogeyman. It has bothered me my whole life\\nbecause I was running away from it. Then I started embracing it. I turned that into\\nthe biggest gift in my life. I started teaching people\\nhow to turn rejections into opportunities. I use my blog, I use my talk, I use the book I just published, and I\\'m even building technology to help\\npeople overcome their fear of rejection. When you get rejected in life, when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure, consider the possibilities. Don\\'t run. If you just embrace them, they might become your gifts as well. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Translator: Tanya Cushman\\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs Thank you, Louis. So, rejection and regret. They both sound pretty awful, don\\'t they? But I like one a lot better\\nthan the other, and I\\'ll tell you why. How many of you had a day in your lives\\nthat something very important happened? You can still remember it. Raise your hand. All of you. Good. How many of you remember a day\\nthat nothing happened? Raise your hand. Still some of you. Good. How many of you is 17 years old right now? Good. Actually, I\\'m not. (Laughter) But I remember a day\\nwhen absolutely nothing happened, and that\\'s when I was 17 years old. It was a random morning, and I was a freshman\\nat the University of Utah. I was walking from a dorm room\\nto my physics class, and there was a snowstorm\\nthe night before, and the entire campus\\nwas covered with white. And as I was walking across\\nthe tennis courts or the soccer fields, I still remember the (Voo voo) sound\\nas I was stepping on fresh snow. I felt good. I felt great. Just three years prior,\\nI was in Beijing, China. Bill Gates came to my hometown, and ever since, I\\'d dreamed\\n[of coming] to America to become this entrepreneur\\nand change the world the way he did. And three years later,\\nthe first part happened: I came, I enrolled at a good university, and I was ready to learn, I was ready to explore, I was ready to build, and I was ready to conquer. The fresh snow field\\nwas like the universe to me and ready for me to blaze my own trail. I felt the world was in front of me;\\neverything was possible. I was on top of the world. I still remember that day\\nwhen, actually, nothing happened. I remember it so much\\nthat I took a picture of it. (Laughter) I wasn\\'t completely naked. When you\\'re 17, you get carried away. You know that. (Laughter) But 13 years went by\\nin the blink of an eye. I graduated, worked, found a job,\\nmade money, went to graduate school, found a better job, made more money, (Laughter) got married, bought a house, bought a dog, and one day I woke up -\\nI was 30 years old. And I just got the news\\nthat we\\'re about to have a baby. (Applause) Well, actually,\\nwhen I first heard the news, I was a little bit depressed. (Laughter) It\\'s not like babies are not good; babies are great. I would recommend it to anyone\\nwhen the timing is right. (Laughter) But the thing is,\\nwhen you become a parent, your responsibilities\\nand your priorities change. The odds of you becoming\\na world-changing entrepreneur goes way down. So where was that young man\\nwho was standing on the snow? And where did his dream go? Nope. He didn\\'t blaze his own trail. In fact, he followed a path\\nthat everyone else did, and it was the road that was very safe, but he knew where it would lead to, which is security, but regret. Regret. There was once a nurse\\nworking in a hospice, and she served the dying patients. In fact, she interviewed\\nthousands of them, asking them this question: What\\'s your biggest regret in life? And the number one answer is \"I wish I had the courage\\nto live a life that\\'s true to myself, not to someone else\\'s expectation.\" I was 30 and I was healthy,\\nand I already had that regret. But a good thing is I wasn\\'t dying\\nand I could do something about it. (Laughter) So my wife and I decided\\nnot to let regret rule our lives, so she asked me to go out and quit my job\\nand build my company for six months. If by the end, there\\'s no traction or investment,\\nI\\'ll look for a job again. And I was excited. So, this is the day my son was born, and four days before that, I quit my job to become\\na full-time entrepreneur. So, by avoiding regret,\\nI met another character: rejection. Four months into my venture, I was presented with\\na major investment opportunity. And I really wanted it. I thought I was destined to get it. I wanted it so bad, I dreamed\\nabout it five different times. I can still remember\\nthe feeling in those dreams, and when I woke up, I was about to call my wife and my parents\\nand tell them the news. But then reality hit. One day, I was in a restaurant\\ncelebrating my friend\\'s birthday, and my phone vibrated, and I took it out, and I saw a simple message\\nthat said, \"No.\" I had to step out of the restaurant so other people wouldn\\'t see me\\ncry in front of them. I couldn\\'t believe\\nhow a simple two-letter word would have this impact on me. And it wasn\\'t like\\nI didn\\'t mentally prepare. And it wasn\\'t like I wasn\\'t well-educated. But it really hurt. So I was given another choice. I could have just quit\\nand looked for a job again and saved myself two months of time\\nand made more money, but by doing that,\\nit would be back to regret again because I did not try to give my hardest\\nand go the full length of six months. But if I kept going, I would - even more than likely -\\nI would go through the same process and get rejected again, and that was terrifying. So rejection and regret. They both stunk, but I had to choose. And in the end, I chose rejection, and it kept going. And you know what? The world was never the same to me again. So I started looking for help\\nto overcome rejection, and I searched online,\\nand I found this game. It\\'s called \"Rejection Therapy.\" It\\'s a game developed\\nby this Canadian gentleman. His name\\'s Jason Comely, and he actually asks you\\nto go out and look for rejection. That\\'s a great idea. (Laughter) I loved it; I loved it so much,\\nI said not only I would do it, I would do it for 100 times\\nand I\\'ll film myself and blog it and tell the world about it\\nso the world will keep me accountable. So I started going out\\nand asked for some crazy stuff to get rejected. For example, one day I went to a FedEx,\\nand I gave them a package, saying \"Can you send this to Santa Claus?\" And there\\'s another day, I went to a Costco\\nand talked to a store manager, saying, \"Hey, can I use your intercom\\nto talk to your customers?\" (Laughter) And then one day, I just found\\na random office building. I walked in and say,\\n\"Hey, can I just talk to your CEO?\" They\\'re like, \"Why?\" \"Because I want to challenge him\\nto a staring contest.\" (Laughter) But those were the noes. But the funny thing is,\\nI start getting yeses. And a lot more than I thought. And here are some of them. For example, one day\\nI knock on a stranger\\'s door saying, \"Can I play soccer\\nin your backyard?\" He\\'s like, \"Sure. Come on in.\" (Laughter) And one day I was flying. After my plane landed,\\nI talked to the captain, saying, \"Can you teach me how to fly?\" He\\'s like, \"Come to my cockpit.\" (Laughter) And then one day,\\nI was driving by a store and I saw the security camera and asked them, \"Hey, can I\\nactually dance on the security camera? Then you can show me on the monitor?\" They said, \"That sounds fun.\" (Laughter) So this is my first Gangnam Style dance. (Laughter) So - and then there\\'s this: it\\'s a box of donuts\\nthat looks like Olympic rings. It changed my life, so much so that I decided\\nto divide up my life between BD and AD,\\nbefore donuts and after donuts. (Laughter) And here\\'s what happened. (Off-screen) I\\'m driving\\ntoward Krispy Kreme. (Video) I\\'m going to ask them\\nto make me some specialized donuts, and we\\'ll see what happens. Clerk: What kind of specialized donuts\\nare you talking about? Jia Jiang: I\\'d like to have a - give me a - you link\\nthe five donuts together, make them look like Olympic symbols. Clerk: Oh. [Oops, she seems interested] And when are you looking to these? JJ: Huh? Clerk: When? [Did not expect this question] JJ: Uh, the next 50 minutes. Clerk: Let me see what I can do. JJ: Okay. Clerk: I tried, but what do you think? JJ: Wow. [She googled it and got the color right.] JJ: That is really good.\\nThat\\'s really good. Yeah. All right. So do I pay there? Clerk: Don\\'t worry about that.\\nThat one\\'s on me. JJ: Are you serious? Clerk: Yes. Yes. [At this very moment,\\nI knew why Gandhi ever lived] [because with people like Jackie,\\nmankind is worth saving after all.] JJ: All right. Thank you. All right. See you. Give me a hug. Okay. All right. Thank you. See you. (Applause) (Cheers) And that was only\\na shortened version of the video. The full video got\\nover 5 million views on YouTube. If just six months ago you told me rejection could be fun,\\ndelicious and sweet, I would say you\\'re crazy. In fact, I would give you\\na rejection right there. (Laughter) But now I\\'m having\\nthe best time of my life. I actually learned a lot\\nabout myself as well. I\\'m a better communicator; I\\'m a better negotiator; I\\'m even a better dancer. (Laughter) But more importantly, I can see rejection eye-to-eye\\nand remain very calm and see it as what it is. It\\'s actually not this monster bag of hurt\\nthat I had really thought. It\\'s actually not some\\nuniversal truth about who I am; it\\'s just someone\\'s opinion. It actually says\\njust as much about that person, the person who rejected me, as about me. So - and I can even turn the table and improve myself using rejection. So because of that donut video, people started following\\nmy rejection blog, and people started sending me emails and thanking me because\\nthey find this very inspiring. And also, they told me stories of how they\\'re trying to overcome\\ntheir fear of rejection. For example, there\\'s this artist here in Austin, and her [artworks] are amazing;\\nthey\\'re beautiful and profound. But no one noticed. So after the donuts video, she told me, she\\'s like, \"Well, the donuts are nice,\\nbut I\\'m a real artist, and if you have the courage to ask that, why shouldn\\'t I just\\ntell people about it.\" So she started telling news media\\nand her friends, and the art touched a lot of lives\\nand made national news. And then there\\'s this man who told me that he\\'s always had\\nthis fear of rejection, so much so that sometimes\\nhe goes to restaurants, he didn\\'t even dare to ask for ketchup,\\nbecause his stomach would churn. Then just last year,\\nhis wife was diagnosed with cancer. And he said he learned that the American hospitals\\nare not this perfect place we all think, that everything works. Sometimes, you have to push\\nthe doctors and nurses to get things done. And then he saw my video; he\\'s like, \"You have the courage to ask\\nstrange requests for rejection therapy. I\\'m trying to save my wife\\'s life here, and why shouldn\\'t I ask?\" So he did, and he thanked me. So, rejection is really like chicken. It can be yummy or yucky;\\nit depends on how you cook it. (Laughter) But it\\'s a fear of rejection\\nthat cripples us, so much so that we often reject ourselves\\nso others wouldn\\'t reject us. But if we let that fear dictate our lives, companies might not be built,\\nor quit prematurely. Art might not be shared\\nand appreciated by the world. And life-saving treatments\\nmight be delayed. And it will all lead us to one place: regret. Regret is someone else\\'s opinion of us; it comes and goes - rejection is that thing. Rejection comes and goes, but regret is our own opinion of ourselves\\nand always stays with us. In fact, regret is like rotten meat. It\\'s just bad; it gets worse over time. I chose to embrace rejection\\nand open myself up to the world and found it to be a beautiful place\\nwith amazing people and amazing things. Had I not done that,\\nI would have not seen any of that. And now it\\'s my life passion to actually help others\\nto overcome their fear of rejection so they will not meet regret. I feel like the 17-years-old\\nfreshman in college again, stepping on the fresh snow field, and every step, it could be rejection\\nand it could be an acceptance, and I don\\'t know where it will lead to, but I know one thing: it\\'s not going to be to regret. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers) Thank you. Thank you.', \"Transcriber: Emil-Lorant Cocian\\nReviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo Welcome. I came here today to warn you about the dangers of ice-cream. You may not be aware of this, but these innocent looking cones full of sweetness are one of the major causes of drownings. And I've got the numbers to prove it. So, if you plot a graph of the number of ice-creams that are sold, and you compare it with the number of drownings, you can see there is clearly an upwards trend, and I think it's very safe to conclude from this that we should ban ice-cream because it's very dangerous. (Laughter) (Applause) Since you're all smart people, you've probably figured out there's something wrong with my example. What's really happening here is, of course, that there is an underlying factor, which is nice weather, you might have guessed it. And if the weather is nice, more people will go out swimming, and unfortunately drown, and at the same time, more people will buy ice-cream. And it's not the ice-cream that's causing the drownings. And here it's really easy to see that there is something wrong, but jumping to an incorrect conclusion about causality when you see a correlation is the most often made logical mistake. And today my goal is to make sure that in the future you can recognize this mistake. And I really hope you can avoid making it in the future for yourselves. And I'll do this by just giving some famous examples. And the first one is really rather innocent. The fact is that married men live longer than single men. If you look at the statistics, you see that this is really happening. And women's magazines, they like to conclude from this that marriage is very healthy for men, because it makes them live longer. Well, a friend of mine, he likes to joke that marriage mainly makes life seem longer, but -- (Laughter) -- that's because his wife is -- (Cheers) (Applause) But so, can anyone guess what's going on here? Because there is a causal relation, but it's the other way around. The fact is that men who are healthy, and rich, and well educated, and have a much higher life expectancy, these are the men that are much more likely to find a wife -- that's the way women are -- and the guys who have a very low life expectancy, so they're unhealthy and poor, they are not as likely to get married. So it's the high life expectancy that is causing the marriage, not the other way around. Well, and this, of course, you know, it's not so serious, no one will get married just because he read this. So let's move to a more serious example. It was also more serious research. In Nature there was a study in 1999 that showed that young kids who sleep with the lights on, that they have a much higher probability of becoming short-sighted later in life. But the researchers, they were smart, and they wrote very careful that they had found a correlation, and they didn't know how the causal relation might work, but just to be sure they advised all parents to turn off the lights at night. And in the popular media this became that bed lamps were night abuse, children's abuse, and that it was very bad if parents used lamps in the bedroom. And many parents were worried. I can imagine, if this would have happened when my son was sleeping with the lights on, I would had felt really bad. But luckily, the article had to be corrected the next week, and maybe some of you can guess, and if there are biologists in the audience, they know. Short-sightedness is genetic. And so, it's parents who are short-sighted. And those are the parents who like to leave the light on in the bedroom, and they also are the parents who have short-sighted kids. So again, a simple mistake, easy to make. Then, what is I think the worst example I know -- I know many of them, I see at least one of these in the newspapers every week. But this is a classic one: in the '70s, researchers found that there is a very strong link between kids who do well in school, get good grades, and kids who have a high self-esteem. And they concluded from this that it's very important to make sure that young kids are, you know, raised to be confident and proud of themselves, because if their self-esteem is high, the good results will follow. And this forethought was told to parents, especially in the US, for generations, that just make sure that your kid is proud and confident, then all will turn out well. And many years later, someone did another study just to see in which direction the cause was working. And they found that it was in the opposite direction. So the good grades were causing the self-esteem, and self-esteem wasn't causing good grades. And it was even worse. So kids who are raised just to have high self-confidence, and not excel at anything -- it can be sports or music, doesn't have to be school -- the kids who are just proud of themselves, and then fail at everything, in the end they will have a very low self-esteem, and not be able to make anything of their life. So this was a very serious correlation mistake. And what I want for today is for you to remember that the next time someone wants to prove that there is a causal relation between something and something else -- it can be anything, it can be vaccines and autism, it can be female bankers and the financial crisis, and if they -- (Laughter) -- point out to you that there is a very strong relation, remember that it's not enough to have a correlation. It gives a very good hint of what might be happening, but before you can conclude that one thing causes something else, you need to know why it does and how it does. So, when in doubt, just remember the ice-cream. Thank you very much. (Applause)\", 'Translator: Riaki Poništ\\nReviewer: Peter van de Ven Thank you so much. I am a journalist. My job is to talk to people\\nfrom all walks of life, all over the world. Today, I want to tell you why I decided to do this with my life\\nand what I\\'ve learned. My story begins in Caracas, Venezuela, in South America, where I grew up; a place that to me was,\\nand always will be, filled with magic and wonder. Frоm a very young age, my parents wanted me\\nto have a wider view of the world. I remember one time\\nwhen I was around seven years old, my dad came up to me and said, \"Mariana, I\\'m going to send you\\nand your little sister...\" - who was six at the time - \"...to a place where nobody\\nspeaks Spanish. I want you to experience\\ndifferent cultures.\" He went on and on about the benefits\\nof spending an entire summer in this summer camp in the United States, stressing a little phrase that I didn\\'t pay \\ntoo much attention to at the time: \"You never know what the future holds.\" Meanwhile, in my seven-year-old mind, I was thinking, we were going\\nto get to summer camp in Miami. (Laughter) Maybe it was going to be even better, and we were going to go\\na little further north, to Orlando, where Mickey Mouse lived. (Laughter) I got really excited. My dad, however,\\nhad a slightly different plan. Frоm Caracas, he he sent us\\nto Brainerd, Minnesota. (Laughter) Mickey Mouse was not up there, (Laughter) and with no cell phone,\\nno Snapchat, or Instagram, I couldn\\'t look up any information. We got there, and one of the first things I noticed was that the other kids\\' hair\\nwas several shades of blonde, and most of them had blue eyes. Meanwhile, this is what we looked like. The first night, the camp director\\ngathered everyone around the campfire and said, \"Kids, we have a very\\ninternational camp this year; the Atencios are here from Venezuela.\" (Laughter) The other kids looked at us\\nas if we were from another planet. They would ask us things like, \"Do you know what a hamburger is?\" Or, \"Do you go to school\\non a donkey or a canoe?\" (Laughter) I would try to answer\\nin my broken English, and they would just laugh. I know they were not trying to be mean; they were just trying\\nto understand who we were, and make a correlation\\nwith the world they knew. We could either be like them, or like characters out of a book\\nfilled with adventures, like Aladdin or the Jungle Book. We certainly didn\\'t look like them, we didn\\'t speak their language, we were different. When you\\'re seven years old, that hurts. But I had my little sister\\nto take care of, and she cried every day at summer camp. So I decided to put on a brave face, and embrace everything I could\\nabout the American way of life. We later did what we called\\n\"the summer camp experiment,\" for eight years in different cities\\nthat many Americans haven\\'t even heard of. What I remember most about these moments\\nwas when I finally clicked with someone. Making a friend was a special reward. Everybody wants to feel\\nvalued and accepted, and we think it should happen\\nspontaneously, but it doesn\\'t. When you\\'re different,\\nyou have to work at belonging. You have to be either\\nreally helpful, smart, funny, anything to be cool for the crowd\\nyou want to hang out with. Later on, when I was in high school, my dad expanded on his summer plan, and from Caracas he sent me\\nto Wallingford, Connecticut, for the senior year of high school. This time, I remember\\ndaydreaming on the plane about \"the American high school\\nexperience\" - with a locker. It was going to be perfect, just like in my favorite TV show:\\n\"Saved by the Bell.\" (Laughter) I get there, and they tell me that my assigned roommate\\nis eagerly waiting. I opened the door, and there she was, sitting on the bed, with a headscarf. Her name was Fatima,\\nand she was Muslim from Bahrain, and she was not what I expected. She probably sensed my disappointment\\nwhen I looked at her because I didn\\'t do too much to hide it. See, as a teenager,\\nI wanted to fit in even more, I wanted to be popular, maybe have a boyfriend for prom, and I felt that Fatima just got in the way with her shyness\\nand her strict dress code. I didn\\'t realize\\nthat I was making her feel like the kids at summer camp made me feel. This was the high school\\nequivalent of asking her, \"Do you know what a hamburger is?\" I was consumed by my own selfishness and unable to put myself in her shoes. I have to be honest with you, we only lasted a couple\\nof months together, because she was later sent\\nto live with a counselor instead of other students. I remember thinking, \"Ah, she\\'ll be okay. She\\'s just different.\" You see, when we label\\nsomeone as different, it dehumanizes them in a way. They become \"the other.\" They\\'re not worthy of our time,\\nnot our problem, and in fact, they, \"the other,\"\\nare probably the cause of our problems. So, how do we recognize our blind spots? It begins by understanding\\nwhat makes you different, by embracing those traits. Only then can you begin to appreciate\\nwhat makes others special. I remember when this hit me. It was a couple months after that. I had found that boyfriend for prom, made a group of friends, and practically forgotten about Fatima, until everybody signed on to participate\\nin this talent show for charity. You needed to offer a talent for auction. It seemed like everybody\\nhad something special to offer. Some kids were going to play the violin, others were going to recite\\na theater monologue, and I remember thinking, \"We don\\'t practice talents\\nlike these back home.\" But I was determined\\nto find something of value. The day of the talent show comes, and I get up on stage\\nwith my little boom box, and put it on the side and press \"Play,\" and a song by my favorite\\nemerging artist, Shakira, comes up. And I go, \"Whenever, wherever,\\nwe\\'re meant to be together,\" and I said, \"My name is Mariana,\\nand I\\'m going to auction a dance class.\" It seemed like the whole school\\nraised their hand to bid. My dance class really stood out from, like, the 10th violin class\\noffered that day. Going back to my dorm room,\\nI didn\\'t feel different. I felt really special. That\\'s when I started\\nthinking about Fatima, a person that I had failed to see\\nas special, when I first met her. She was from the Middle East, just like Shakira\\'s family\\nwas from the Middle East. She could have probably taught me\\na thing or two about belly dancing, had I been open to it. Now, I want you all to take that sticker that was given to you \\nat the beginning of our session today, where you wrote down\\nwhat makes you special, and I want you to look at it. If you\\'re watching at home,\\ntake a piece of paper, and write down what makes you different. You may feel guarded when you look at it, maybe even a little ashamed,\\nmaybe even proud. But you need to begin to embrace it. Remember, it is the first step\\nin appreciating what makes others special. When I went back home to Venezuela, I began to understand\\nhow these experiences were changing me. Being able to speak different languages, to navigate all these\\ndifferent people and places, it gave me a unique sensibility. I was finally beginning to understand the importance of putting myself\\nin other people\\'s shoes. That is a big part of the reason\\nwhy I decided to become a journalist. Especially being from a part of the world\\nthat is often labeled \"the backyard,\" \"the illegal aliens,\"\\n\"third-world,\" \"the others,\" I wanted to do something to change that. It was right around the time, however, when the Venezuelan government shut down the biggest television station\\nin our country. Censorship was growing, and my dad came up to me\\nonce again and said, \"How are you going to be\\na journalist here? You have to leave.\" That\\'s when it hit me. That\\'s what he had been preparing me for. That is what the future held for me. So in 2008, I packed my bags,\\nand I came to the United States, without a return ticket this time. I was painfully aware\\nthat, at 24 years old, I was becoming a refugee of sorts,\\nan immigrant, the other, once again, and now for good. I was able to come on a scholarship\\nto study journalism. I remember when they gave me\\nmy first assignment to cover the historic election\\nof President Barack Obama. I felt so lucky, so hopeful. I was, like, \"Yes, this is it. I\\'ve come to post-racial America, where the notion of us and them\\nis being eroded, and will probably\\nbe eradicated in my lifetime.\" Boy, was I wrong, right? Why didn\\'t Barack Obama\\'s presidency\\nalleviate racial tensions in our country? Why do some people still feel threatened by immigrants, LGBTQ, and minority groups who are just trying to find a space in this United States\\nthat should be for all of us? I didn\\'t have the answers back then, but on November 8th, 2016, when Donald Trump became\\nour president, it became clear that a large part of the electorate\\nsees them as \"the others.\" Some see people coming to take their jobs, or potential terrorists\\nwho speak a different language. Meanwhile, minority groups oftentimes\\njust see hatred, intolerance, and narrow-mindedness on the other side. It\\'s like we\\'re stuck in these bubbles\\nthat nobody wants to burst. The only way to do it,\\nthe only way to get out of it is to realize that being different\\nalso means thinking differently. It takes courage to show respect. In the words of Voltaire: \"I may not agree\\nwith what you have to say, but I will fight to the death\\nto defend your right to say it.\" Failing to see anything good\\non the other side makes a dialogue impossible. Without a dialogue, we will keep\\nrepeating the same mistakes, because we will not learn anything new. I covered the 2016 election for NBC News. It was my first big assignment\\nin this mainstream network, where I had crossed over\\nfrom Spanish television. And I wanted to do something different. I watched election results\\nwith undocumented families. Few thought of sharing that moment\\nwith people who weren\\'t citizens, but actually stood\\nthe most to lose that night. When it became apparent\\nthat Donald Trump was winning, this eight-year-old girl named Angelina\\nrushed up to me in tears. She sobbed, and she asked me\\nif her mom was going to be deported now. I hugged her back and I said,\\n\"It\\'s going to be okay,\" but I really didn\\'t know. This was the photo we took that night,\\nforever ingrained in my heart. Here was this little girl who was around the same age I was\\nwhen I went to camp in Brainerd. She already knows she is \"the other.\" She walks home from school\\nin fear, every day, that her mom can be taken away. So, how do we put ourselves\\nin Angelina\\'s shoes? How do we make her\\nunderstand she is special, and not simply unworthy\\nof having her family together? By giving camera time to her\\nand families like hers, I tried to make people see them\\nas human beings, and not simply \"illegal aliens.\" Yes, they broke a law, \\nand they should pay a penalty for it, but they\\'ve also given\\neverything for this country, like many other immigrants\\nbefore them have. I\\'ve already told you how my path\\nto personal growth started. To end, I want to tell you how I hit\\nthe worst bump in the road yet, one that shook me to my very core. The day, April 10th, 2014, I was driving to the studio,\\nand I got a call from my parents. \"Are you on the air?\" they asked. I immediately knew something was wrong. \"What happened?\" I said. \"It\\'s your sister;\\nshe\\'s been in a car accident.\" It was as if my heart stopped. My hands gripped the steering wheel, and I remember hearing the words: \"It is unlikely she will ever walk again.\" They say your life can change\\nin a split second. Mine did at that moment. My sister went from being\\nmy successful other half, only a year apart in age, to not being able to move her legs, sit up, or get dressed by herself. This wasn\\'t like summer camp,\\nwhere I could magically make it better. This was terrifying. Throughout the course of two years,\\nmy sister underwent 15 surgeries, and she spent the most\\nof that time in a wheelchair. But that wasn\\'t even the worst of it. The worst was something so painful,\\nit\\'s hard to put into words, even now. It was the way people looked at her, looked at us, changed. People were unable to see\\na successful lawyer or a millennial with a sharp wit\\nand a kind heart. Everywhere we went, I realized that people just saw\\na poor girl in a wheelchair. They were unable to see\\nanything beyond that. After fighting like a warrior, I can thankfully tell you\\nthat today my sister is walking, and has recovered\\nbeyond anyone\\'s expectations. (Applause) Thank you. But during that traumatic ordeal, I learned there are differences\\nthat simply suck, and it\\'s hard to find positive in them. My sister\\'s not better off\\nbecause of what happened. But she taught me: you can\\'t let\\nthose differences define you. Being able to reimagine yourself\\nbeyond what other people see, that is the toughest task of all, but it\\'s also the most beautiful. You see, we all come\\nto this world in a body. People with physical\\nor neurological difficulties, environmentally impacted communities,\\nimmigrants, boys, girls, boys who want to dress as girls,\\ngirls with veils, women who have been sexually assaulted, athletes who bend\\ntheir knee as a sign of protest, black, white, Asian, Native American,\\nmy sister, you, or me. We all want what everyone wants:\\nto dream and to achieve. But sometimes, society tells us,\\nand we tell ourselves, we don\\'t fit the mold. Well, if you look at my story, from being born somewhere different,\\nto belly dancing in high school, to telling stories\\nyou wouldn\\'t normally see on TV, what makes me different is what has made me\\nstand out and be successful. I have traveled the world, and talked to people\\nfrom all walks of life. You know what I\\'ve learned? The single thing every one of us\\nhas in common is being human. So take a stand to defend\\nyour race, the human race. Let\\'s appeal to it. Let\\'s be humanists,\\nbefore and after everything else. To end, I want you to take that sticker,\\nthat piece of paper where you wrote down\\nwhat makes you different, and I want you to celebrate it\\ntoday and every day, shout it from the rooftops. I also encourage you\\nto be curious and ask, \"What is on other people\\'s\\npieces of paper?\" \"What makes them different?\" Let\\'s celebrate those imperfections\\nthat make us special. I hope that it teaches you that nobody\\nhas a claim on the word \"normal.\" We are all different. We are all quirky, and unique, and that is what makes us\\nwonderfully human. Thank you so much. (Applause)', 'Last summer when I was alone in Tallin Estonia, I had to face a challenge this challenge was the simple phrase and many others like it \"Tere tulemast\" I presume none of you speak Estonian I take that as a no so and I was in the same situation as you are right now back in the last summer, because I never spoke Estonian, never read Estonian book never watch an Estonian movie, never actually seen Estonian song or met anybody from Estonian I had to act quickly, I had to be able to day one single spot, be able to understand what the barista was saying when I was ordering my coffe, be able to understand what the passport security person was asking me at the airport, when I was coming to Estonia I was living Tallin, I had to be able to comprehend the language, to comprehend it at that very single moment, and this experience reised the question. How can one learn a language in a very limited amount of time, comprehend it, be able to act with it, be able to work with it , to meet people with it and most of all progress in it. I attended to talk last september which was right above this issue it was held by a polyglot, she was from Slovakia and was willing to talk about how he/she is learning, how she was learning and is still learning to this day new languages, she told us of people that spek six, ten, twelve, sixteen languages even they devote their whole lives to this idea of being able to comprehend every single one of them, or as many as they could, and if you were thinking that there is a magical way, some magical secret which she told me, I have to disappoint you there is no single super method. The polyglots all of them worldwide agree one thing there is no way one fastest way how to learn a language, it has to be personal, you have to be able to choose a personal way and find it, and find your language through a personal personal way and modify it as much ass you possibly can to suit you to suit your type of learning. Some people prefer stuck thier head for vocabulary and to fill it with words and phrases until they head bursts some of us prefer to watch a movie to talk with a person in a pub or like me when going back from the librer working in a essay for six hours till dying morning meet a drunken Frenchman and talk to him in play French and practice as much as I can. There are many ways, some people even prefer those video games that you know your phone\\'s you know the memorizes and those kind of things I\\'m not much fan of that but that\\'s a personal thing again today what I\\'ll be presenting to you is something differente, it is or these are four points which are intrinsic to our learning, which are building blocks of any learning of any language you will ever do doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s a Chinese, if it\\'s Arabic if it\\'s Hebrew, Estonian, French, Spanish, any language will so ever these four things: message, importance, observation, comprehension all amount of the same thing the same goal learning a language effectively and they all are as you\\'ll soon find interconnected. You can not just focus on one of them, you can not just focus on importance and hope that you will through this relevance to who you are you´ll be to able to learn quickly or similarly you can not just focus on comprehension as we do in our schools nowadays, we focus too much on memorizing vocabulary or learning phrases about whatever thing that there prescribed by the booklets, but that´s not how you learn a language. I´ll get into them more later once the progress through the talk. The first one is message some of you this might seem a bit bizarre, but would I be my message, it is well you´ll see yourselves. This sentence in in Stonian since you know we speak Stonian I´m not going to be asking what actually means but does anybody or rather let me read it, I´m not fluent Stonian so just like be ready with me so. Speaking Stonian Now still you have no clue what this actually means, I don´t presume that from some magical learning of some broken Stonian magically speak or learn, understand this one phrase but already you can see that there is yah twice and because language is logically structured, you are able to deduce that, probably because also these two works are the same endings this one, and this one and then these two then maybe that means end and already in less than 30 secconds you understand one word in languages you´ve never seen in your whole life, and through progressing like this, through making these small steps you´re able to actually learn it. What if I put another sentence here in a language of some of you speak, maybe more that some of you, maybe all of you. But certain that is more familiar, because we are anglephone, francophone society, so most of us presumably and, what if I put another, one which all of us speak, in English. This is how you learn a language, once you find the meaning, the message behind a sentence you´re able to acquire the language, there are signifers in a language, which all help you to build a logical structure of this set language. When you understand the message, you unconsciously acquire language, this doesn´t mean that by understand one phrase from the charter of human rights from the United Nations you understand Stonian or French or English for that matter. It simply means that you will have the bulding blocks with which you can build the learning, you have this, the logical structure which build on this language. Then you have importance, every language, no matter what it is has to be useful to you, has to be relevant to you, has to be something you enjoy. When I was in school many years ago, in my elementary school I was forced to study Spanish, I hate it, I couldn´t stand it. Nothing against Spanish, nothing against that It was just simply didn´t enjoy it I could´t learn a single sentence. When I was in Italy for my ..... Edinburgh residential trip, I decided to study Italian and I was like yes, I´m gonna learn this language and I failed because I was not able to enjoy it, because I just didn´t enjoy, and actually from the one trip, I had more from Swedish, because I met a Swedish friend that I´m still in talk in contact to this day. It is this enjoyment is relevance to you that is important. It has to be relevant to ours education, something that you want to learn because you want to progress in your life. Has to be relevant because of your family, your friends, if you find enjoyment in it. It has to be relevant because of your job maybe you have a job in I don´t know Ireland or Stockholm and you need to learn the language to be able to work with it, and like me maybe it´s through the travels because being international, this what this whole day is about, means that you want to open yourself to other opportunities. For me that means to see different cultures in different worlds and as a part of that, you have to be able to speed the language at least some degree. Languages are tools just like any other part of our lives, they can be used in some meaningful way once you find this what this meaningful way is you´re to able to learn much faster and therefore chooses languages useful to you. Now on to observation and this is probably the part that I think might be one the most important simply because it can be so easily. This photo was taken when I was also last summer walking to the Mont Blank in between France, Italy and Switzerland and when I took it I was jus crossing the Italian-French border I juts came from a little refugee on the French side, and was walking up the mountain to cross the Italian side and in the same day I spoke French and Italian My French is by no means good but I´m able to talked with it, Italian is much harder, but still I was to able to comprehend the people ask for a bed and a dire situation not be forced to sleep outside and wind and freezing cold because they´ll be not being enjoyable at all. And from it I realized that there are two key things, that you have to be actually immerse yourself in a language to some degree, you cannot just stand set at home and hope the language will come to you that the knowledge that you are able to do with will actually come to you some like that, you have to be actually able to put yourself there to pay attention to observe how people are doing, how they speak, how they emote and hopefully from that build up your knowledge and this is actually a key thing and I think people should start doing this you should be look for something called: parent speaker Now this is what I learned during the talk about the polyglots back in september, it is an idea that when you´re speaking a new language you´re like a baby, you have don´t know how to actually operate language, you´re just put in a world we´re all adults speaking in a foreign language and you´re hoping to crack grab grasp a meaning about it, grasp something that you can´t know it´s a world that you can´t understand, what you need is a parent speaker, somebody that will speak to you in the same level, will help you learn new words and will actually correct you, will actually give you advice how to speak better and will now diminish you in any sort of way. That is key because when you´re able to practice you speaking you´re learning in that sense that you learn faster because and this is actually gonna be the very next slide I think afterwards so I´m gonna quickly get this sorry for that. When you actually learn a language through comprehension, through observation you are able to then speak the language, and this is one of the most important things because how else would you communicate with people especially when you want travel, you need to be able to act on your knowledge . You have to be able to actually find somebody that you can talk to an equal sense and you have to be able to listen a lot. People don\\'t want to listen they revert back to English they revert back to to their natural tongue because they are scared don\\'t be scared this gonna sound like a great cliche don\\'t be scared to make mistakes, make them. They\\'re gonna be corrected by people and you gonna learn from that. And now the other thing that I was hoping to talk about Comprehension. And this thing can be slipt into two parts memory and comprehension or knowledge And I feel like nowadays in schools what we do is we just stuff our heads with vocabulary until they explote we shouldn\\'t be do that because memory or knowledge is in comprehension like for example I know one sentence in Irish speaking Irish does it mean I speak Irish by no means I don\\'t even properly know what the sentence means but I know that it\\'s Irish I have that one piece of knowledge but I couldn\\'t say I comprehend the language by no means whatsoever and that\\'s the issue we force ourselves to learn complex vocabulary that is nor relevant to us. We force to stuff our heads with words that don\\'t be are any meaning and that will never probably use ever in our lives we don\\'t actually focus on comprehending them comprehending the structure and the sentences to actually using our existing knowledge from other languages from my maternal tongues to actually progress further. We should be doing that we should be trying to learn with use of our existing languages we should be using a native tongues we should be using our abilities to speak from they one we should be looking at actions more than words or nouns . When you learn what it means the word to hurt it\\'s still more useful than actually what it means what the word arm is it You can be like hurt but what do we do with it an arm it doesn\\'t work like that. Actions are more important than words and this sort of progress is somenthing that\\'s key for learning a language effectively. So I presented to you today is four principles and some key points some things that maybe you\\'ve heard some things that you that maybe we\\'re new to you the parent speaker probably . All these things are essential you can remove one and hope that the others will come with it or that you focus only on one of them and completely disregard the others it is important to push yourselfs to your limits to go out there and this is gonna sound like a great cliche once again but to push yourself go out there and actually experience the language firsthand. No school, no institution no book can ever give you that and just only very end I would like to dispel one last thing that I\\'ve been told in past that I\\'ve heard people tell me or people tell other people, that it\\'s talent that\\'s required that for being able to learn languages you need talent you need to be able to have this magical skill with things that you\\'re born with, it\\'s no true anyone can learn language anyone I\\'ve known when they push themselves hard enough they\\'re able to speak a language some people are far superior to me and ther are probably hundreds and millions alike that. But it is that thing that you push yourselves that differentiates you from other people this push. So don\\'t be scared to push. Thank you.', 'Transcriber: Jelena Vukovic\\nReviewer: Ivana Korom There is one phrase that\\nI have always wanted to say to everyone in my life. That phrase is \"Life is easy.\" It\\'s so easy and fun. I never thought like that before. When I was in Bangkok, I felt like\\nlife is very hard, very complicated. I was born in a poor village\\non the Northeastern of Thailand And when I was a kid,\\neverything was fun and easy, but when the TV came,\\nmany people came to the village, they said, \"You are poor, you need to chase\\nsuccess in your life. You need to go to Bangkok\\nto pursue success in your life.\" So I felt bad, I felt poor. So I needed to go to Bangkok. When I went to Bangkok,\\nit was not very fun. You need to learn, study\\na lot and work very hard, and then you can get success. I worked very hard,\\neight hours per day at least, but all I could eat was just\\na bowl of noodles per meal, or some Tama dish\\nof fried rice or something like that. And where I stayed was very bad,\\na small room where a lot of people slept. It was very hot. I started to question a lot. When I work hard, why is my life so hard? It must be something wrong, because I produce a lot of things,\\nbut I cannot get enough. And I tried to learn, I tried to study. I tried to study in the university. It\\'s very hard to learn in university,\\nbecause it\\'s very boring. (Laughter) And when I looked at subjects\\nin the university, in every faculty, most of them\\nhad destructive knowledge. There\\'s no productive knowledge\\nin university for me. If you learn to be\\nan architect or engineer, that means you ruin more. The more these people work,\\nthe mountain will be destroyed more. And a good land in Chao Praya Basin will be covered\\nwith concrete more and more. We destroy more. If we go to agriculture faculty\\nor something like that, that means we learn how to poison, to poison the land, the water, and learn to destroy everything. I feel like everything we do\\nis so complicated, so hard. We just make everything hard. Life was so hard\\nand I felt disappointed. I started to think about,\\nwhy did I have to be in Bangkok? I thought about when I was a kid, nobody worked eight hours per day, everybody worked two hours,\\ntwo months a year, planting rice one month\\nand harvesting the rice another month. The rest is free time,\\nten months of free time. That\\'s why people have\\nso many festivals in Thailand, every month they have festival. (Laughter) Because they have so much free time. And then in the daytime,\\neveryone even takes a nap. Even now in Laos, go to Laos if you can, people take a nap after lunch. And after they wake up, they just gossip, how\\'s your son-in-law,\\nhow\\'s your wife, daughter-in-law. People have a lot of time, but because they have a lot of time, they have time to be with themselves. And when they have time\\nto be with themselves, they have time to understand themselves. When they understand themselves, they can see what they want in their life. So, many people see\\nthat they want happiness, they want love,\\nthey want to enjoy their life. So, people see\\na lot of beauty in their life, so they express that beauty in many ways. Some people by carving\\nthe handle of their knife, very beautiful, they weave the baskets very nicely. But, now, nobody does that. Nobody can do something like that. People use plastic everywhere. So, I feel like\\nit\\'s something wrong in there, I cannot live this way I\\'m living. So, I decided to quit University, and went back home. When I went back home,\\nI started to live like I remember, like when I was a kid. I started to work two months a year. I got four tons of rice. And the whole family, six people, we eat less than half a ton per year. So we can sell some rice. I took two ponds, two fish ponds. We have fish to eat all year round. And I started a small garden. Less than half an acre. And I spend 15 minutes per day\\nto take care of the garden. I have more than 30 varieties\\nof vegetables in the garden. So, six people cannot eat all of it. We have a surplus to sell in the market. We can make some income, too. So, I feel like, it\\'s easy,\\nwhy did I have to be in Bangkok for seven years, working hard\\nand then not have enough to eat, but here, only two months a year\\nand 15 minutes per day I can feed six people. That\\'s easy. And before I thought\\nthat stupid people like me who never got a good grade at school, cannot have a house. Because people who are cleverer than me, who are number one\\nin the class every year, they get a good job, but they need to work more\\nthan 30 years to have a house. But me, who cannot finish university,\\nhow could I have a house? Hopeless for people\\nwho have low education, like me. But, then I started to do\\nearthly building, it\\'s so easy. I spend two hours per day,\\nfrom 5 o\\'clock in the morning, until 7 o\\'clock in the morning,\\ntwo hours per day. And in three months, I got a house. And another friend\\nwho\\'s the most clever in the class, he spent three months\\nto build his house, too. But, he had to be in debt.\\nHe had to pay for his debt for 30 years. So, compared to him, I have\\n29 years and 10 months of free time. (Laughter) So, I feel that life is so easy. I never thought I could\\nbuild a house as easy as that. And I keep building a house every year,\\nat least one house every year. Now, I have no money,\\nbut I have many houses. (Laughter) My problem is in which house\\nI will sleep tonight. (Laughter) So, a house is not a problem,\\nanybody can build a house. The kids, 13 years old, at the school, they make bricks together,\\nthey make a house. After one month, they have a library. The kids can make a house, a very old nun can build\\na hut for herself. Many people can build a house. So, it\\'s easy. If you don\\'t believe me, try it. If somebody wants to have a house. And then, the next thing is clothing. I felt like I\\'m poor,\\nlike I\\'m not handsome. I tried to dress like somebody else,\\nlike a movie star. To make myself look good, look better. I spent one month to save money\\nto buy a pair of jeans. When I wore them,\\nI turned left, I turned right, looked in the mirror. Every time I look, I am the same person. The most expensive pants\\ncannot change my life. I felt like I\\'m so crazy,\\nwhy did I have to buy them? Spend one month to have a pair of pants. It doesn\\'t change me. I started to think more about that. Why do we need to follow fashion? Because, when we follow fashion,\\nwe never catch up with it, because we follow it. So, don\\'t follow it, just stay here. (Laughter) Use what you have. So, after that, until now, 20 years,\\nI have never bought any clothes. All the clothes I have\\nare leftovers from people. When people come to visit me,\\nand when they leave, they leave a lot of clothes there. So, I have tons of clothes now. (Laughter) And when people see me\\nwear very old clothes, they give me more clothes. (Laughter) So, my problem is, I need\\nto give clothes to people very often. (Laughter) So, it\\'s so easy. And when I stopped buying clothes,\\nI felt like, it\\'s not only clothes, it\\'s about something else in my life, What I learned is that\\nwhen I buy something, and I think about,\\nI buy it because I like it, or I buy it because I need it. So, if I buy it because I like it,\\nthat means I\\'m wrong. So, I feel more free\\nwhen I think like this. And the last thing is,\\nwhen I get sick, what will I do? I really worried in the beginning,\\nbecause then I had no money. But, I started to contemplate more. Normally, sickness is a normal thing,\\nit\\'s not a bad thing. Sickness is something to remind us\\nthat we did something wrong in our lives, that\\'s why we got sick. So, when I get sick, I need\\nto stop and come back to myself. And think about it, what I did was wrong. So, I learned how to use\\nwater to heal myself, how to use earth to heal myself, I learned how to use\\nbasic knowledge to heal myself. So, now that I rely on myself\\nin these four things, I feel like life is very easy, I feel something\\nlike freedom, I feel free. I feel like I don\\'t worry\\nabout anything much, I have less fear, I can do\\nwhatever I want in my life. Before, I had a lot of fear,\\nI could not do anything. But, now I feel very free,\\nlike I\\'m a unique person on this Earth, nobody like me, I don\\'t need\\nto make myself like anybody else. I\\'m the number one. So, things like this\\nmake it easy, very light. And, after that,\\nI started to think about that when I was in Bangkok,\\nI felt very dark in my life. I started to think that many people\\nmaybe thought like me at the time. So, we started a place called\\n\"Pun Pun\" in Chiang Mai. The main aim is just saving seed. To collect seed,\\nbecause seed is food, food is life. If there is no seed, no life. No seed, no freedom. No seed, no happiness. Because your life\\ndepends on somebody else. Because you have no food. So, it\\'s very important to save seed. That\\'s why we focus on saving seed. That\\'s the main thing in Pun Pun. And the second thing\\nis it is the learning center. We want to have a center\\nfor ourselves to learn, learn how to make life easy. Because we were taught to make\\nlife complicated and hard all the time. How can we make it easy? It\\'s easy, but we don\\'t know\\nhow to make it easy anymore. Because we always make it complicated and now, we start to learn,\\nand learn to be together. Because, we were taught\\nto disconnect ourselves from everything else, to be independent, so we can rely on the money only. We don\\'t need to rely on each other. But now, to be happy,\\nwe need to come back, to connect to ourselves again,\\nto connect to other people, to connect our mind and body\\ntogether again. So, we can be happy. Life is easy. And from beginning until now,\\nwhat I learned is the four basic needs:\\nfood, house, clothes and medicine must be cheap and easy for everybody, that\\'s the civilization. But, if you make these four things hard\\nand very hard for many people to get, that\\'s uncivilized. So, now when we look\\nat everywhere around us, everything is so hard to get. I feel like now is the most\\nuncivilized era of humans on this Earth. We have so many people\\nwho finish university, have so many universities on the Earth, have so many clever people on this Earth. But, life is harder and harder. We make it hard for whom? We work hard for whom right now? I feel like it\\'s wrong, it\\'s not normal. So, I just want to come back to normal. To be a normal person,\\nto be equal to animals. The birds make a nest in one or two days. The rats dig a hole in one night. But, the clever humans like us spend 30 years to have a house, and many people can\\'t believe\\nthat they can have a house in this life. So, that\\'s wrong. Why do we destroy our spirit,\\nwhy do we destroy our ability that much? So, I feel that it\\'s enough for me,\\nto live in the normal way, in the abnormal way. So, now I try to be normal. But, people look at me\\nas the abnormal one. (Laughter) A crazy person. But, I don\\'t care,\\nbecause it\\'s not my fault. It\\'s their fault, they think like that. So, my life is easy and light now. That\\'s enough for me. People can think whatever they want. I cannot manage anything outside myself. What I can do is change my mind,\\nmanage my mind. Now, my mind is light\\nand easy, that\\'s enough. If anybody wants to have a choice,\\nyou can have a choice. The choice to be easy or to be hard,\\nit depends on you. Thank you. (Applause)', 'I\\'m a veteran of the starship Enterprise. I soared through the galaxy driving a huge starship with a crew made up of people from all over this world, many different races, many different cultures, many different heritages, all working together, and our mission was to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. Well — (Applause) — I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America, boldly going to a strange new world, seeking new opportunities. My mother was born in Sacramento, California. My father was a San Franciscan. They met and married in Los Angeles, and I was born there. I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941 by Japan, and overnight, the world was plunged into a world war. America suddenly was swept up by hysteria. Japanese-Americans, American citizens of Japanese ancestry, were looked on with suspicion and fear and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor. And the hysteria grew and grew until in February 1942, the president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, ordered all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast of America to be summarily rounded up with no charges, with no trial, with no due process. Due process, this is a core pillar of our justice system. That all disappeared. We were to be rounded up and imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps in some of the most desolate places in America: the blistering hot desert of Arizona, the sultry swamps of Arkansas, the wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and two of the most desolate places in California. On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday, and just a few weeks after my birthday, my parents got my younger brother, my baby sister and me up very early one morning, and they dressed us hurriedly. My brother and I were in the living room looking out the front window, and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway. They carried bayonets on their rifles. They stomped up the front porch and banged on the door. My father answered it, and the soldiers ordered us out of our home. My father gave my brother and me small luggages to carry, and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out, and when my mother finally came out, she had our baby sister in one arm, a huge duffel bag in the other, and tears were streaming down both her cheeks. I will never be able to forget that scene. It is burned into my memory. We were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other Japanese-American families. There were guards stationed at both ends of each car, as if we were criminals. We were taken two thirds of\\nthe way across the country, rocking on that train for four days and three nights, to the swamps of Arkansas. I still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me. I remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us. I remember the searchlight that followed me when I made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine. But to five-year-old me, I thought it was kind of nice that they\\'d lit the way for me to pee. I was a child, too young to understand the circumstances of my being there. Children are amazingly adaptable. What would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps. It became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall. It became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower. Being in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp, became my normality. When the war ended, we were released, and given a one-way ticket to anywhere in the United States. My parents decided to go back home to Los Angeles, but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place. We were penniless. Everything had been taken from us, and the hostility was intense. Our first home was on Skid Row in the lowest part of our city, living with derelicts, drunkards and crazy people, the stench of urine all over, on the street, in the alley, in the hallway. It was a horrible experience, and for us kids, it was terrorizing. I remember once a drunkard came staggering down, fell down right in front of us, and threw up. My baby sister said, \"Mama, let\\'s go back home,\" because behind barbed wires was for us home. My parents worked hard to get back on their feet. We had lost everything. They were at the middle of their lives and starting all over. They worked their fingers to the bone, and ultimately they were able to get the capital together to buy a three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood. And I was a teenager, and I became very curious about my childhood imprisonment. I had read civics books that told me about the ideals of American democracy. All men are created equal, we have an inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and I couldn\\'t quite make that fit with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment. I read history books, and I couldn\\'t find anything about it. And so I engaged my father after dinner in long, sometimes heated conversations. We had many, many conversations like that, and what I got from them was my father\\'s wisdom. He was the one that suffered the most under those conditions of imprisonment, and yet he understood American democracy. He told me that our democracy is a people\\'s democracy, and it can be as great as the people can be, but it is also as fallible as people are. He told me that American democracy is vitally dependent on good people who cherish the ideals of our system and actively engage in the process of making our democracy work. And he took me to a campaign headquarters — the governor of Illinois was\\nrunning for the presidency — and introduced me to American electoral politics. And he also told me about young Japanese-Americans during the Second World War. When Pearl Harbor was bombed, young Japanese-Americans,\\nlike all young Americans, rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country. That act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face. We were denied service, and categorized as enemy non-alien. It was outrageous to be called an enemy when you\\'re volunteering to fight for your country, but that was compounded with the word \"non-alien,\" which is a word that means \"citizen\" in the negative. They even took the word \"citizen\" away from us, and imprisoned them for a whole year. And then the government realized that there\\'s a wartime manpower shortage, and as suddenly as they\\'d rounded us up, they opened up the military for service by young Japanese-Americans. It was totally irrational, but the amazing thing, the astounding thing, is that thousands of young Japanese-American men and women again went from behind those barbed-wire fences, put on the same uniform as that of our guards, leaving their families in imprisonment, to fight for this country. They said that they were going to fight not only to get their families out from behind those barbed-wire fences, but because they cherished the very ideal of what our government stands for, should stand for, and that was being abrogated by what was being done. All men are created equal. And they went to fight for this country. They were put into a segregated all Japanese-American unit and sent to the battlefields of Europe, and they threw themselves into it. They fought with amazing, incredible courage and valor. They were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally. There is one battle that illustrates that. It was a battle for the Gothic Line. The Germans were embedded in this mountain hillside, rocky hillside, in impregnable caves, and three allied battalions had been pounding away at it for six months, and they were stalemated. The 442nd was called in to add to the fight, but the men of the 442nd came up with a unique but dangerous idea: The backside of the mountain was a sheer rock cliff. The Germans thought an attack from the backside would be impossible. The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible. On a dark, moonless night, they began scaling that rock wall, a drop of more than 1,000 feet, in full combat gear. They climbed all night long on that sheer cliff. In the darkness, some lost their handhold or their footing and they fell to their deaths in the ravine below. They all fell silently. Not a single one cried out, so as not to give their position away. The men climbed for eight hours straight, and those who made it to the top stayed there until the first break of light, and as soon as light broke, they attacked. The Germans were surprised, and they took the hill and broke the Gothic Line. A six-month stalemate was broken by the 442nd in 32 minutes. It was an amazing act, and when the war ended, the 442nd returned to the United States as the most decorated unit of the entire Second World War. They were greeted back on the White House Lawn by President Truman, who said to them, \"You fought not only the enemy but prejudice, and you won.\" They are my heroes. They clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country, and they proved that being an American is not just for some people, that race is not how we define being an American. They expanded what it means to be an American, including Japanese-Americans that were feared and suspected and hated. They were change agents, and they left for me a legacy. They are my heroes and my father is my hero, who understood democracy and guided me through it. They gave me a legacy, and with that legacy comes a responsibility, and I am dedicated to making my country an even better America, to making our government an even truer democracy, and because of the heroes that I have and the struggles that we\\'ve gone through, I can stand before you as a gay Japanese-American, but even more than that, I am a proud American. Thank you very much. (Applause)', 'Translator: Cynthia Betubiza\\nReviewer: Ivana Korom Code is the next universal language. In the seventies, it was punk music\\nthat drove the whole generation. In the eighties, it was probably money. But for my generation of people, software is the interface\\nto our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically, radically\\nmore diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical\\nand lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things\\nthat they can tinker and turn around and twist,\\nand so forth. My personal journey into the world\\nof programming and technology started at the tender age of 14. I had this mad teenage crush\\non an older man, and the older man in question\\njust happened to be the then Vice President\\nof the United States, Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single\\nteenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow\\nexpress all of this love, so I built him a website, it\\'s over here. And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook,\\nthere was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express\\nall of this longing and loving. And that is how programming\\nstarted for me. It started as a means of self-expression. Just like when I was smaller,\\nI would use crayons and legos. And when I was older, I would use\\nguitar lessons and theater plays. But then, there were other boys,\\nother things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers\\nare boring and technical and lonely. Here\\'s what I think today. Little girls don\\'t know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good\\nat concentrating on things and being exact and they ask\\namazing questions like, \"What?\" and \"Why?\"\\nand \"How?\" and \"What if?\" And they don\\'t know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. It\\'s the parents who do. It\\'s us parents who feel like computer science\\nis this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it\\'s almost as far removed\\nfrom everyday life as, say, nuclear physics. And they are partly right about that. There\\'s a lot of syntax\\nand controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community,\\nwe\\'ve made computers smaller and smaller. We\\'ve built layers and layers\\nof abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer\\nhave any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids\\nhow the human body works, we teach them how\\nthe combustion engine functions and we even tell them\\nthat if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks, \"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?\" Or, \"How does the computer know\\nwhat happens when I press \\'play,\\' how does it know which video to show?\" Or, \"Linda, is Internet a place?\" We adults, we grow oddly silent. \"It\\'s magic,\" some of us say. \\'It\\'s too complicated,\" the others say. Well, it\\'s neither. It\\'s not magic and it\\'s not complicated. It all just happened\\nreally, really, really fast. Computer scientists built\\nthese amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them\\nvery, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak\\nto the computers so that we don\\'t know\\nhow to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces. And that\\'s why no one recognized that when I was conjugating\\nFrench irregular verbs, I was actually practicing\\nmy pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following\\na sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell\\'s lifelong quest to find an exact language\\nbetween English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer, but no one knew it. The kids of today, they tap, swipe\\nand pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools\\nto build with computers, we are raising only consumers\\ninstead of creators. And I believe that,\\nif JavaScript is the new lingua franca, instead of grammar lessons,\\nwe should be teaching poetry classes. This whole quest\\nled me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. She is completely fearless,\\nimaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time\\nI would run into a problem in trying to teach\\nmyself programming like, \"What is object-oriented design\\nor what is garbage collection?\", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old\\nlittle girl would explain the problem. And I wrote a book about her\\nand I illustrated it and the things\\nRuby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you\\'re\\nnot supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems\\nstuck together. And Ruby also introduced\\nme to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn\\'t want\\nto play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots\\nthat are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who\\'s really ruthlessly efficient,\\nbut somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes, and so on. In Ruby\\'s world, you learn\\ntechnology through play. And, for instance, computers\\nare really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach\\nloops goes like this. This is Ruby\\'s favorite dance move,\\nit goes, \"Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump.\" And you learn counter loops\\nby repeating that four times. And you learn while loops\\nby repeating that sequence while I\\'m standing on one leg. And you learn until loops\\nby repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) You learn decomposition skills\\nby problem solving flow charts and seeing what went wrong\\nin Ruby\\'s friends\\' practicalities. You learn that algorithms\\nare much like cupcake recipes. And most of all, you learn\\nthat there are no ready answers. When coming up with the curriculum\\nfor Ruby\\'s world, I needed to really ask the kids\\nhow they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize\\nplay testing sessions. I have three little stories for you\\nfrom those play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids\\nthese four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. And I would ask, \"Which one of these\\ndo you think is a computer?\" And the kids would be\\nvery conservative and go, \"None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is: it\\'s that glowing box in front of which mom or dad\\nspends way too much time.\" But then we would talk and we would discover\\nthat actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog - a dog\\nmight not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have\\na computer inside of it. And grocery stores, they have\\nso many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system\\nand the burglar alarms. And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there\\'s even hackers who hack them. (Laughter) And we go further and I give them these little stickers\\nwith an on/off button on them. And I tell the kids,\\n\"Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room\\ninto a computer.\" And again, the kids go, \"Sounds really hard,\\nI don\\'t know the right answer for this.\" But I tell them, \"Don\\'t worry, your parents don\\'t know\\nthe right answer, either. They\\'ve just started\\nto hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids,\\nyou are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world\\nwhere everything is a computer.\" Your washing machine, toothbrush,\\neven your milk bottle. And that you\\'re the last generation\\nthat will remember the computer as a glowing box. And then I had this little girl\\nwho came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, \"This bicycle lamp,\\nif it were a computer, it would change colors.\" And I said, \"That\\'s a really good idea,\\nwhat else could it do?\" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, \"If this bicycle lamp\\nwere a computer, we could go on a biking trip\\nwith my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp\\ncould also be a movie projector.\" And that\\'s the moment I\\'m looking for, not the moment when the kid writes\\nthe prefect Ruby array, the moment when the kid realizes that the world\\nis definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way\\nof making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us\\ncan be a part of that change. Final story, we also built a computer, the glowing box,\\nthe archaic glowing box. And we got to know the bossy CPU\\nand the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we\\'ve assembled\\nour computer together, we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy, he\\'s six years old and his favorite thing in the world\\nis to be an astronaut. And the boy, he has\\nthese huge headphones on and he\\'s completely immersed\\nin his tiny paper computer because you see, he\\'s built his own intergalactic planetary\\nnavigation application. And his father, the lone astronaut\\nin the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy\\'s important mission is to bring the father\\nsafely back to earth. And these kids are going to have\\na profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology. Finally, the more approachable,\\nthe more inclusive, and the more diverse\\nwe make the world of technology, the more colorful and better\\nthe world will look like. Because disruption\\ndoesn\\'t start with technology. Disruption starts\\nwith the people with a vision. And computer science, and programming\\nand technology the very DNA of all of these things\\nis humanity. Computers, after all,\\nthey used to be humans who were really, really good\\nat calculating things. And still today, programmers\\ndon\\'t write the code only for the machine to execute. They write the code for other\\nprogrammers to read and build upon. So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made\\ndon\\'t only include the twentysomething-year-old\\nSilicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls\\nand Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where\\nthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent\\nreality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic\\nand brave about technology. They embrace the powers\\nand the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology\\nthat is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird. When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings\\nin Moominvalley. In the afternoons,\\nI would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings,\\nI would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out\\nto be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories, I do them with code. Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules\\nand paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing\\nwith the pure power of logic. And that probably makes me a poet. Thank you. (Applause)', 'I was born during a war that still engulfs\\nmy country, Afghanistan. When I was growing up,\\nviolence was all around me. I remember sitting\\nin my living room with my family when a distant thud\\nwould jerk us all out of our seats. As the sound of the rockets\\ncame closer and closer, our bodies would coil and freeze. My grandmother would take charge\\nof her terrified flock and shepherd us into a room\\nin the back of the house. No less exposed, but to us,\\nit somehow felt safer. I\\'d cling to my granny and clench my fists wondering why this was happening to us. I clearly remember\\nmy little brother\\'s face wincing every time we heard a rocket fall. It was this violence, this war that still goes on today, which forced my family to leave our home. We left early one morning\\nnot knowing where we would end up. Along the way, there was more violence. We drove on roads with landmines, and everywhere we went,\\nthere was hostility. The overriding memory\\nin my body of those years is of feeling unsafe. Feeling as though something terrible\\nwould happen to me or to my family. We worried about our friends\\nand family back home. My grandmother was still in Kabul,\\nand I missed her terribly. I\\'d go to bed at night\\nand say the prayers she taught me to pray for her safety. We wanted nothing more\\nthan to go back home. But when the Taliban took over\\nthe country in 1996, my parents realized\\nthat was no longer an option. So after four years of living in exile, we sought asylum in the UK\\nand began a new life. I started going to school. And almost 25 years later,\\nI\\'m standing here with you. I\\'m now working to help others\\novercome devastation by war. To overcome the trauma\\nof being expendable. In my work, I see how living under constant\\nthreat of violence and feeling unsafe can affect people, even when they manage to get out. War leaves a physical legacy in our body, our mind and in our spirit. When I tell people about my life, they sometimes say\\nit\\'s a remarkable story. But this is not true. Millions of people are living\\nthrough war and displacement, trying to survive. For these people, like my family, the dream isn\\'t to get rich or to go on vacations\\nor to buy that perfect house. They have a modest, yet somehow still extravagant\\ndream of being safe. They dream of a day\\nwhen they can go to the market without the fear of violence. Or send their kids to school without being afraid for their lives. War is dislocating. It gets inside your body\\nand makes you into a thing, a corpse. It can dislodge empathy, hope and joy and replace them with fear. The fear that comes from living\\nin the violence of war can break social bonds, disbanding the very communities\\nwe rely on for safety. Women and children I work with\\ncomplain about pain in their body. Children as young as three or four\\ntalk about hurt in their bellies and not because they\\'re hungry. It\\'s a pain I know well. A constant, dull ache all over your body, and it feels as though nothing\\ncan alleviate it. People have nightmares\\nand experience overwhelming emotions: grief, sadness and anger. \"Why did I deserve this,\" they wonder. This is the situation facing 84 million\\nforcibly displaced people. And according to UNHCR,\\nmore than half are women and children. What\\'s even more startling is the number of people\\nliving in active conflict zones. According to Save the Children, 420 million children are growing up\\nin places where violence is the norm. These are families and children\\nsubject to forces they cannot control. Yet war and violence don\\'t become normal. The stress and trauma experienced\\nby people who go through war is itself deadly. Illnesses like cancer, diabetes and heart disease have been linked to trauma\\nand chronic stress. But it\\'s the psychic pain\\nthat affects people the most. Depression, PTSD\\nand other psychiatric disorders affect a significant percentage\\nof people who go through war. I was shocked when I learned\\nthat since 9/11, four times more US soldiers\\nhave taken their own lives than died in combat. Reconciling to normal life\\nafter you\\'ve seen life-shattering war can be the hardest of tasks\\nfor a human being. But mental health and healing\\nare often overlooked when supporting people\\nwho have survived war. And that\\'s why I set up\\nRefugee Trauma Initiative, to help support the mental health\\nof those affected by war and displacement. Our organization is one of several\\naround the world that helps people so they can begin to feel safe again. When feeling safe is splintered and you feel unsafe and unseen, we work to help bring\\nthe internal safe system back online. We create spaces where people can convene and heal as a community. In our groups, men, women and children\\nreconnect with their bodies, have the space to express\\nwhat they are feeling, and most importantly, reconnect with others. We use art, mindfulness, dance and storytelling to help make sense of the dislocating\\nexperiences of violence and of being forced to leave your home. And everything that we do\\nis underpinned by value-based practice. We practice understanding, curiosity and respect to everyone\\nwho comes through the door. We recognize and acknowledge their trauma without pathologizing or medicalizing\\ntheir very normal human reaction to the reckless violence\\nthey\\'ve experienced. And we recognize that these experiences\\nare the result of systemic injustice and oppression that often\\nhave colonial roots, which has dehumanized\\nand killed people for centuries. At the heart of our work is a simple\\nyet fundamental notion that feelings of safety are inextricably tied to feeling\\nconnected to a community. A community where you feel\\nworthy and seen. Where your suffering\\nwill be recognized and cared for, where you can experience belonging. Understanding how violence and conflict\\naffects and changes people is more important than ever. Our world is embroiled\\nin multiple chronic conflicts that seem to have no end in sight. Since 1945, there have been 150\\nconflicts around the world, and the overwhelming majority\\nof casualties have been civilians. We can\\'t talk about this human toll of war without talking about the war industry. The war on terror over the last 20 years\\nunleashed a new kind of violence, displacing 38 million people. This is a war that made\\ndrone warfare the norm. Drones enable automated extermination. As we are moving closer and closer\\ntowards automation of war, what happens when we outsource violence, the extinguishing of a human life, to a computer? What happens to us\\nas an interconnected global community when a machine and not a human decides whether a life is worth something? This is all bleak, but not hopeless. There\\'s always room to adjust\\nour trajectory to a better future. I\\'m standing here in the most powerful\\ncountry in the world, a citizen of the United Kingdom, two countries that have long\\nheld power over war and peace. And the first thing that we can do is demand that our governments\\nstop investing in mass destruction. At a time when we need to invest\\nin tackling climate change and in health care, our governments are financing\\nweapons and drones. Every vote that we cast should be\\nagainst weapons of mass destruction, against automation of war. (Applause) And you can do something\\nin your own community. Right now, there are literally\\nmillions of Afghans who are brutally forced\\nto leave their home. Like them, there are Syrians,\\nIraqis, Burundians who all have to deal with the fallout\\nof war and displacement. And the antidote to their suffering\\nlies in the kindness and connection of the communities\\nwhere they find themselves. If they can feel safe there, they can begin to heal and start a new life. It\\'s sometimes hard for us to see that the answers to some of the most\\ncomplicated problems in the world lie in the simplest of human actions. It may sound too easy that a good neighbor can help\\nto heal the wounds of war. But in my experience, this is true. Before we landed in London,\\nafter months of hardship, we stopped in a poor neighborhood\\nof a town in Central Asia. I was forlorn, grief stricken and not yet able to imagine\\na future without violence. One day, a neighborhood teacher\\nknocked on our door. When we opened the door, we saw a kindly middle-aged woman carrying a box of pens, colored pencils, paper and children\\'s books. She asked my parents if she could come in\\nand spend time with us. They let her in, and from that day, she visited us most days after school. When I told her that I desperately\\nwanted to go to school, she took me to her classroom, where the girls had prepared gifts. They taught me how to sing a song. It wasn\\'t long before we had to move on, and once we left, I never saw her again. But what she did\\nmade me feel valued and safe. The memory of that experience\\nhad left a blueprint of what it felt to inhabit my body, if only for a moment, without fear. A memory of joy and belonging. And to this day, when I feel the opposite, I can close my eyes\\nand feel that connection. And it carries me through the dark days. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Translator: Bob Prottas\\nReviewer: Leonardo Silva Beyond natural.\\nIt\\'s always better to go beyond natural. In your private or professional life,\\nanywhere and anytime, try to push your limits\\nwell beyond your comfort zone. Try to not stay comfortable and, with that, reach things\\nyou\\'ve never imagined before. But what does it mean\\nto \"go beyond natural\"? Well, I believe that you don\\'t need to do\\na huge thing to make something different. In reality, those big things\\nlike employing hundreds of people, saving lives somewhere in Africa, or representing your country\\nwhen you are part of its government, are the result of many little things, hundreds, thousands, little things\\nthat you do in all your life. Of course,\\nyou must be ambitious in your life. But, at the same time,\\nyou need to be very patient. Because you only reach\\nyour most desired goals with a lot of hard work,\\na few risks and a little bit of luck. And this may take years. So, today I\\'m here to show you\\nthat a little thing, in some way different than usual,\\nmay lead to something great. The best example that I have for you\\nhappened to me last year. It started with a simple challenge: waking up at 4:30 am\\nfor 21 consecutive days. A challenge that I gave the name\\nof #21earlydays. This is the reason I am here today,\\nand the reason I was featured on Business Insider, also on national TV, newspapers and radio. But why? Probably you will agree with me\\nthat this is quite unusual but, at the same time, this is something\\nthat anyone in the world could do, too. I don\\'t have any special power\\nto wake up at 4:30 am. But this is something\\nthat everyone can do. There are millions of people\\ndoing that everyday. But if we take a better look at it, you see that my challenge\\nwasn\\'t to wake up so early. What I challenged was a global status quo\\nthat says how your life must be, what you must study, where you must work,\\nwhat you must watch on TV, and also at what hour you must wake up. I confess: many times I also fall\\nin this chain where you just follow what the others do,\\nwithout questioning why. So, why the hell am I waking up so early? What is the reason behind it? The story behind it\\nis very simple, in fact. One day, I was thinking about why I was\\ndoing my days the way I was doing and what I could improve in my life to be a better person. I remembered reading some articles\\nin the press, about how early some of the most\\nsuccessful CEO\\'s in the world wake up, and so I decided to take a chance on it.\\nI thought it was interesting. But why 21 days?\\nWell, 21 days, I put a limit of 21 days because there are theories that say\\nthat it is the right amount of time you need to form a new habit. I didn\\'t know if it would work, but for me it was more for the sake\\nof establishing a goal. A thing that I always apply to life\\nis to always establish a goal when you want to reach\\nor change something in your life. Because only in this way will you\\nunderstand if you succeeded or failed. So, I started to share a lot of thoughts\\nwith my network. The advantages of it, the little pleasures\\nand also my progress. Many people started following\\nwhat I was doing. And 2 or 3 weeks later, there were already people trying\\nto do the same, waking up so early. But -- This thing about #21earlydays\\nreally exploded when I shared a blog post on Medium\\nabout the lessons I have learnt from that. Thousands of people saw my blog post. My blog post was also republished on Business Insider with more than\\n1 million views, and the Twitter feed around\\n21 early days is endless, still today. So, what did I learn with this? These were my lessons: 1. Find support along the way. It is always better to find these people\\nthat will push you forward and will hold you accountable for failing,\\neven if they criticize you. This is my blog post --\\nmy Facebook post, the original one, about the challenge, and where I was more exposed\\nto many people. 2.\\tPeople like to see different things. And come on, a young guy like me,\\nwaking up so early, is different. At least it\\'s not what people see\\non Facebook (Chuckling) and at least people see different pictures\\non their Instagram feed. 3. No. You don\\'t need to sleep less. One thing that happened a lot was a lot of people, horrified, asking me: \"So you sleep less.\\nHow do you manage to do that?\" And I say: \"OK, I don\\'t sleep less.\\nI only go to bed earlier.\" This is what she is saying. That means:\\nBed early and rise early. In fact this is simple.\\nI slept a few hours before. 4. Get rid of your obstacles.\\nThis is really important. When you want to change\\nsomething in your life, it\\'s important to eliminate\\nall the obstacles because it becomes much easier\\nto reach your final goal. 5. A healthy life is really important\\nif you want to sleep properly. So I sleep well, I eat well and I exercise,\\nand it helps a lot with that. I fall asleep really fast,\\n5 minutes on average. I sleep well and anywhere if needed, and I wake up without any problems, and this helps a lot, of course\\nwith my challenge. This is me exercising.\\nSo it\\'s proof that I exercise. 6. Forget snooze, please. For me this is one of the worst inventions\\never on mankind. Come on,\\nit doesn\\'t help you with anything. You delay for 10 minutes, 20 minutes,\\n30 minutes of your life. There are studies that say that you\\nget more tired sleeping that time, and you are wasting your time\\nfor more interesting things. So forget this.\\nNothing good comes from snooze. 7. I only need 6 or 7 hours of sleep. This is me waking up a little bit. I swear that I\\'d like to sleep, but my body only demands\\nthis much time for sleep. So why waste my time with sleep when there are a lot of things\\nthat are way more interesting? 8. I found that doing this,\\nI have more working time. In fact 2 more hours per day. And in the end\\nI can leave the office earlier and have some drinks with my friends\\nenjoying the beautiful sun of Lisbon. 9. I found that it was a better way to get messages out of my way. During the morning no one is working, so I can answer all the emails\\nand messages and I have an Inbox zero\\nand no instant answer for today, and this is a great feeling\\nduring the morning. 10. I also found that I have\\nmore time at the gym. So this is the proof that I go to the gym, and I found that waking up earlier, when I go to the gym I am not so tired. As I worked before for 2 hours\\nthat\\'s not an excuse. It helps a lot on those days when you think that you\\ndon\\'t have enough time to exercise. 11. New view on the world. This gave me a few little pleasures. Like seeing a sunrise when I was running. This is great. 12 and last. \\nYou need the will to do it. But if you have it, no one will stop you. So this challenge was the result\\nof many thoughts and many conversations\\nthat I had in the weeks before. So it was a personal experience that allowed people to think\\nand discuss this subject. Many shared the story. #21earlydays is still today one of the most active\\nhashtags on Twitter, without paying a cent for it. And more important than that,\\neven the best part of it is that still today I continue receiving\\nmessages from people all over the world saying that they are waking up earlier,\\nbecause of me, and that they are happier doing that!\\nThat\\'s great! So, here\\'s my point:\\na small act, but different act, such as waking up at 4:30 am originated a big result such as allowing\\npeople to think and discuss about their own schedules\\nand how to be more productive. None of it was planned, and I never imagined that it would reach\\nso big dimension. But I think this is what happens\\nin everyone\\'s lives if you are willing to take\\nthat extra mile. Like in the butterfly effect,\\nwhere a small change in one stage may lead to large differences\\nin a later stage, anything you do today\\ncan result in a big thing tomorrow, for you and for other people. And this is more likely to happen\\nif you do a lot of little things that you believe\\nthat will improve your life. So, please, never forget: go beyond natural and think different;\\nevery little thing that you do everyday may lead to a big thing,\\na surprising thing in the future. I don\\'t know where\\nyou will be in the future, but I can assure you of one thing, that doing this you will grow, you\\'ll be better person,\\nand you\\'ll be happier. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Transcriber: María Constanza Cuevas\\nReviewer: Tanya Cushman (Referee whistle sound) Good evening! Good evening. How are you? Are you good? Great! Welcome, welcome, welcome to this match. This match will take exactly 18 minutes. OK? And you\\'re all part of the same team: Mechelen. OK? Hey guys, I would like to see\\nfair play on the field, respect and positivity. Is that OK for everyone? Cool. Good luck! One year ago, I decided\\nI wanted to become a football referee. Not because of the money, though. I only get paid 20 euros per match. So I won\\'t really get rich by it, will I? No. I decided to become a referee \\nfor two other reasons. One - to stay in good shape. Two - because I wanted to learn\\nhow not to take things personally. [How not to take things personally?] I can see some people nodding. You are probably thinking, \"Being a referee\\nis the perfect environment to learn how not to take \\nthings personally, isn\\'t it?\" Because the spectators hardly ever \\nshout encouraging or positive things. No. What do they shout? Come on, come on. [Audience:] \"Loser! Are you blind?\" Yeah, yeah, good! As a referee, I am the scapegoat. Apparently, I\\'m always wrong. It\\'s always my fault. And I wanted to learn \\nhow not to take all this personally. Because I really struggle with this. For example, when I drive slowly because I\\'m trying to find\\na specific location and somebody is just\\ndriving behind me, I feel hunted. Especially when they start honking \\nand flashing their headlights, I take it personally. I know I shouldn\\'t, but it just happens. Do you see what I mean? Or when somebody cancels \\nan appointment last minute, I get the feeling\\nthat I\\'m not important enough. Again, I take it personally. Even professionally. I\\'m a public speaker, like tonight. This is what I do. I give keynote speeches,\\nand I really like it as long as I can draw \\nmy audience into my story. Because the very moment \\nI see somebody is not paying attention - for example, when somebody\\nis looking at his smartphone - (snap) it just happens: I take it personally. Relax! You are safe tonight. Don\\'t worry. Feel free to take your smartphones, and you can even start talking \\nto your neighbor. I will not take it personally. Why not? Because now, here and now,\\nI\\'m very conscious that this can happen. And more importantly, \\nI have a strategy to deal with it. So tonight, I would like to share\\nthis strategy with you. Are you interested? Cool. Because, I guess, I\\'m not \\nthe only person in this room who sometimes takes\\nthings personally, right? Imagine - imagine you invite a friend\\nto go to the movies, and she replies, \"Oh, sorry, I have to work.\" But you see a picture on social media of her having dinner\\nwith some friends that very night! Or imagine you really have worked\\nvery hard on a project. You\\'re really proud of the end result, but the only thing you get is criticism. So you come home, and you would like to wind down\\nand share this terrible experience. But while you\\'re telling your story, the other one walks away \\nto switch on the TV. Now, who would take\\none of these situations personally? Show me hands, come on. Lots of you. Why? Why do we take things personally? Somebody says\\nor does something and bam! We feel hurt, neglected, offended, \\nbetrayed by the other one. That\\'s what we believe, though. It\\'s the other person\\'s fault. He\\'s responsible for what we feel. He\\'s the one to blame. Now, hang on, hang on. Who says that? Which part of us is speaking? [Why?] [Ego] It\\'s our ego. Our ego thinks that others\\nshould take us into consideration. Our ego doesn\\'t want \\nto be criticized, hell no! Our ego wants to be acknowledged: \"I\\'m right!\" Is this what you want? Do you want to be right? [Do you want to be right?] (Sigh) That\\'s exhausting. When my ego takes over, \\nI\\'m fighting all day. I\\'m in a constant struggle \\nwith the rest of the world. And it drains my energy. Wouldn\\'t it be so much easier \\nto not take things personally? Because then no one has power over you. You\\'re free. You experience much more \\nharmony and connection between you and other people. Of course! Because your energy \\ncan go towards nice things instead of endlessly battling \\nagainst the things that drive you crazy. So the question is do you want to be right\\nor do you want to be happy? I know what some of you are thinking: \"I will make sure\\nI will be happy by being right.\" Well, how do you do it? How to become happy\\nby not taking things personally? You are standing at the kickoff\\nof the match of your life, the match by which you will learn\\nhow to stop taking things personally. So as a referee,\\nI brought my coin for the toss. And every coin has two sides:\\nheads or tails. And they stand for two strategies, two strategies to no longer\\ntaking things personally. Sir, sir, good evening. You\\'re the captain of this huge team. You can choose: heads or tails? (\"Captain\") Heads. Okay. You\\'re lucky. It\\'s heads! Are you ready for the first strategy? OK, here it comes. First strategy - It\\'s not about me. What do you mean it\\'s not about me? This sounds weird, doesn\\'t it? Because when I take things personally,\\nI\\'m convinced it is about me. When I see someone is looking\\nat his phone, I feel offended. I think, \"Hey, I\\'ve put so much effort\\nand time in this presentation. I want respect.\" I think, \"Me, myself and I.\" Sounds familiar, no? Yeah. But in fact, it isn\\'t about me. What if I try to look at it\\nfrom the other person\\'s perspective, asking myself, \"Why? Why is he or she\\nlooking at his or her smartphone?\" Maybe he has just received an important\\nmessage, one he has been waiting for. Or the topic of my presentation\\nis not really his cup of tea. Could be! Or, on the contrary,\\nhe finds it very interesting and he wants to take notes\\non his smartphone. Very smart to do that, by the way. I simply need to shift my focus\\nfrom \"me\" to \"we,\" and I won\\'t take it personally. If I try to see the intention\\nof the other one, I make space for understanding\\ninstead of irritation. Does this ring a bell with you? When you put your son to bed\\nbut he doesn\\'t want to, he throws himself on the floor,\\nkicking and screaming \"I hate you!\" Do you take that personally? No! No, you don\\'t because you know \\nthis is not about me. It\\'s about what he wants, what he needs. He\\'s angry because he just wants\\nto stay up a bit longer, that\\'s all. So the first strategy \\nto not take it personally is it\\'s not about me. Look at the other person\\'s intention. When a driver is tailgating\\nand flashing his lights, he probably does it\\nbecause he\\'s in a hurry. It\\'s not about me, you see? It\\'s as simple as that. In theory. Because in real life,\\nit turns out to be a hell of a job. Do you have any idea, \\nladies and gentlemen, how many thoughts \\nour brain produces a day? 50,000! And guess how many of them are positive? Only 10,000. So this means that 80% of what we think\\nare negative thoughts. That\\'s a lot, isn\\'t it? When you see two colleagues\\ntalking to each other, and just then, they look at you\\nand they start laughing, do you think, \"Oh, they must have noticed my new shoes\\nand they want them too\"? No! Or do you think, \"Darn, they\\'re laughing at me. They are gossiping about me.\" So it takes a lot of effort \\nto correct yourself and say, \"Hang on. I have no clue! They might be laughing about something\\nthat has nothing to do with me.\" So seeing the positive intention\\nof the other one requires a lot of discipline and training. And that\\'s why I became a referee: to train my brain\\nnot to take things personally. I train my brain\\nan hour and a half a week, the entire period of a match. I say this for the football dummies. Now, before the match, I\\'m warming up. Not only physically, but also mentally. I give myself some pep talk\\nin the dressing room: \"Frederik, watch out. Lots of things will trigger you\\nduring the game. You\\'re going to make decisions\\nwho some will not agree with and they will shout\\nunpleasant things at you.\" So I tell myself, \"Frederik, don\\'t take it personally. It\\'s not about me. They just want to be right. They simply want their team to win.\" You see? When I focus on the intention\\nof the other person, there\\'s no need to take it personally. When I apply this strategy\\nvery consciously, I admit it, I feel much more \\nat ease on the field. When the coach,\\nthe players or the spectators do not agree with my decisions, I\\'m less easily thrown off balance. This strategy, \\nladies and gentlemen, works! But not always, unfortunately. Because some words they shout at me,\\nlike here, do really hit a raw nerve: \"You\\'re a loser. Choose another hobby! You know what? Go fishing!\" Ouch! Maybe they are right. Perhaps I took the wrong decision. Maybe I am a loser. Honestly, that\\'s how I feel sometimes. Do you see this? Every coin has a flip side. When this first strategy -\\nit\\'s not about me - doesn\\'t work, it simply means \"It is about me!\" [It is about me.] I have to look in the mirror\\nand question myself. As a beginning referee,\\nI still feel insecure. Especially me. I never played soccer. It is about me because it has something to do\\nwith my insecurity, I doubt about myself. Or a part of myself\\nthat I haven\\'t come to terms with. Do you see my point, ladies and gentlemen? Even if I know that a driver is only tailgating\\nbecause he\\'s in a hurry, I still take it personally when he honks\\nor he\\'s flashing his headlights. So I must question myself. Probably I was driving too slowly. I\\'m aware of it. I just don\\'t like\\nthat clumsy part of myself. Why else would I \\ntake it personally, right? When I say, \"Ladies and gentlemen,\\nyou are an orange,\" who would take this personally? No one, right? Why not? Because nothing in you believes\\nthat you are in fact an orange. An orange? Unless, of course, that you\\'re a ginger\\nand you feel bad because of that. Which is luckily not the case with me. But - but when someone says,\\n\"Frederik, you are so selfish.\" Ouch! I do take it personally. And it only happens because I know\\nthere is some truth in it. If I\\'m honest, I\\'m aware of the fact that I do not always\\ntake into account other people\\'s needs. When you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are big that this\\nis rooted in your childhood. Maybe as a child\\nyou were never good enough. When you came home with a 9 out of 10, they said, \"Hey, and why not a 10?\" You see? We can only take things personally\\nif it somehow touches a raw nerve. And that\\'s the moment\\nto give yourself some empathy. Ooh, this hurts. Darn! I\\'m longing so hard for recognition, and I feel sad if I don\\'t get it. You see? And you can also - why not? - speak up. Just tell the other one\\nwhat\\'s going on inside you. \"Hey, I\\'m in the middle of my story here, and you just walk away\\nto switch on the TV? It feels as if you don\\'t care\\nabout my story. It\\'s not nice.\" By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel\\nwithout blaming the other one, you increase the chance\\nthat the other one will understand you and take your needs into account. Do you see what I mean? To conclude - how not to take things personally. One - it is not about me! Look at the other person\\'s intention. If that doesn\\'t work: two - it is about me. Give yourself empathy and speak up. Ladies and gentlemen, please, pretty please,\\ndo not take it personally, but I really do hope that you will take\\na couple of things personally within the next hours and days. Only if you do, you can test out \\nthese two strategies. Imagine, just imagine\\nif we could all put this in practice. Wouldn\\'t that enhance\\nour relationships enormously? Together we could create a better world. Wouldn\\'t that be great? And as a referee,\\nI even earn some money by it. Who doesn\\'t like 20 euros to learn\\nhow not to take things personally? Show me hands. Show me hands. Oh, so many. Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now? And who still wants them now? Why do you still want these 20 euros? (Audience member)\\nBecause it\\'s still 20 euros! People may attack you, \\ncriticize you or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words,\\nspit you out or even walk all over you. But remember: whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value. Thank you. (Applause)', \"Translator: Rosa Baranda\\nReviewer: Peter van de Ven Whenever we draw something, we ask ourselves painful questions, such as, 'Is this drawing good?' 'Am I talented?' or worst of all, 'Is this art?' And that leads many of us to say, 'Well, this doesn't look like art.\\nI'm not an artist anyway. I can't draw, and I shouldn't do it.' We would never do that with language. No one would say, 'Well, this just didn't come out\\nlike a poem. I shouldn't speak.' (Laughter) Because we know\\nlanguage is a way to think and get in touch with others. Well, and so is drawing. We've put drawing into\\nthis dark corner of the art world. But drawing is not only\\nabout artistic excellence, personal self-expression,\\nor talent for that matter. Drawing is not about art. Drawing is bigger than art. It is a way to think in pictures - like an architect does\\nwhen she tries to imagine a new building, or a scientist who tries to figure out\\nthe spatial structure of molecules. These people are not\\nonly thinking in words; they are also thinking in pictures. The think visually. You can do that too. And today I want to show you five ways how drawing can support\\nyour visual thinking. Let's get to the first one, intuition. When we want to get better at drawing,\\nthe first thing we might want to do is improve the connection\\nbetween our hands and our eyes. And we can do that\\nwith little exercises like this one, where we just fill\\na piece of paper with circles. We start with bigger ones\\nand gradually fill up the whole space. And exercises like these are\\nphysical workouts for our hands. So they might get\\na little tense now and then, but the stronger our hands become, the better we can control them to draw. Repetitive exercises like these\\nalso have a soothing effect on our minds. We have to focus intentionally\\non our visual sense. So they bore other parts of our thinking, bore them in the best sense of the word. They bore our restless\\nthoughts and worries and make room for a more\\nintuitive visual mindset. And in this intuitive mindset,\\nwe can see beautiful things. Because, you know,\\nseeing beauty is not that easy. The problem is\\nthere are just too many things. We can't see everything -\\nit would be too exhausting - so we have to reduce the amount\\nof information that we take in, and we try to see patterns and order. We also see less. Now, without turning around,\\nask yourselves, What is the person behind you wearing? How many trees did you see in front of\\nthis building when you came in? We don't pay attention to these things,\\nbecause we don't have to. It's much easier to just recognize things\\naround us instead of actually looking. We don't care how many\\nleaves are on a tree or how its branches are shaped, (Laughter) all we need to do is identify the tree\\nso we don't run into it. We reduce the world to labels. But when we draw, we actually have to look\\nand discover the world around us. The labels disappear, and we see\\nwhat is actually there, right now. We situate ourselves in the world. And because we pay such\\nintense attention to what is around us, it becomes a part of us. So when I think back\\nof this beautiful French small town where I spent last summer, I can remember many beautiful details. Because I spent the time\\nand the effort to look and draw them. So I stored those memories\\nin my mind and not on my camera. Now, you might say, 'Okay, I want\\nto discover beautiful things too; I'm going to draw one of those plants.' And the drawing should look\\nsomething like this. So you give it a go, but your drawing might turn out\\nmore something like that. (Laughter) What's going on here? The problem is we tend to draw\\nwhat we already know, and not what we see. Here is a little trick, how you can\\nswitch off what you know. Instead of drawing an object, let's focus on the spaces\\nbetween the object and draw those. Because when there's nothing\\nto recognize for our rational mind, like the leaves or the buds of the plant, it's easier for us to actually\\nobserve the forms in front of us. And when we make observations like these, we can discover extraordinary beauty\\nin ordinary things. Because we don't find beauty; we make the world beautiful\\nby paying attention. Okay, so we know how to get\\ninto an intuitive visual mindset and how to draw what we see. Can we also draw what we cannot see, like our thoughts or emotions? We first have to understand \\nthat the way we see the world and, as a consequence,\\nthe way how we see images has been shaped by evolution. Over millions of years, our surroundings\\nhave taught us how to perceive the world. Gravity, for instance,\\nis very important for us, so we're very sensitive\\nto horizontal and vertical lines. Horizontal lines seem to be\\nstable and resting, like the ground. Vertical lines\\nare in opposition to gravity, as you can see in a standing person\\nor a growing plant. Both horizontal and vertical lines\\nseem to be relatively stable for us. Diagonals are a whole different story. They make us a little uneasy: 'Is this thing going to\\nstand up or tip over?' And it is visual habits like these that are the foundation\\nof our visual language. Now, when I use the term language,\\nI'm using it as a metaphor here. Shapes are very different from words; you can't look up what\\na shape means in a dictionary. And we don't build sentences,\\nbut we build compositions of shapes - compositions that mean something. Here's something you can try. Pick any subject,\\nlike this ladybug, for instance, and arrange it in different ways\\non a piece of paper. Now, observe how\\nthe position of the subject changes what the composition says. Each of these arrangements prompts us\\nto think differently about the ladybug - as a threatening monster, a lover, or maybe someone who got lost. And if you learn compositions like these, if you learn how to use\\ndifferent lines and shapes, then we can draw things\\nthat you can't see. For instance, I made it a habit\\nto draw my thoughts everyday. In fact I have a rule: if I can't draw something,\\nthen I probably haven't understood it yet. So I make little sketches, like this one,\\nwhere I was trying to figure out what's going on in my mind\\nwhen I focus on something. Or this one, where I was wondering about the relationship between\\nthe shapes of our everyday objects and the shapes of our hands. This was about two different sorts\\nof conversations that two people can have. And here I was thinking\\nabout rhythms and language and other types of communication. So over time I've gathered\\nmany, many of these sketches, and they give me an overview\\nof my thoughts about the world. And I can also rearrange\\nthese drawings and see connections. So drawing can also help us to understand. Okay, so we know how to get\\ninto an intuitive mindset, how to discover beauty with drawings, how to draw things that are invisible. What can we do with this? Well, we can imagine something new,\\nsomething that isn't there yet. At the core of creativity are ideas. What is an idea? I like to think of ideas\\nas two thoughts or more that we have and that somehow magically combine\\nin our heads and shape something new. And of course, the more thoughts and knowledge\\nwe have about what already is, the likelier are the chances\\nthat some of those thoughts might combine into something\\nthat could be. Creativity really is all about quantity. Let me give you an example. Let's assume for a minute\\nthat you share my passion for pottery, and you want to come up with a new cup. If you know how to draw things, then you have a visual\\nrepresentation in your mind, and you can combine those,\\nyou can work with those. Let's say you are into football,\\nand you want to imagine a world cup. You can easily imagine it vividly. All you have to do now is draw it. Or let's say you feel a little grumpy today, and you want an angry cup. Or ... you might have a friend\\nwho likes things very orderly. You might come up\\nwith a very precise cup for her. And this type of visual thinking\\nis very powerful because you can imagine something\\nwithout having to make it. So, this is very useful in the first part\\nof your creative process, where you try to come up with as many\\nideas as possible, even the bad ones. Especially the bad ones. We don't judge in this part\\nof the creative process. And then in the second part, when we narrow things down\\nto find out a viable solution, a stupid idea from before might turn out as just \\nthe right birthday present for a friend. And you can apply this way of\\nvisual thinking to all sorts of problems. Because creativity\\nreally is like breathing: you take in information and knowledge, and you combine it\\nto new ideas that you made. And if you know\\nhow to draw what you think, then you have a powerful support\\nfor this process. You can also share\\nthose new ideas with others, in texts or in presentations. Language is probably the most powerful tool\\nwe have to communicate, and yet it has its limits. One problem with\\nwritten words, for instance, is you have to go through them\\nline by line, word by word to know what they say. And as soon as you have,\\nthose words quickly disappear and vanish into a grey texture again. It is hard for us to anchor\\nwords in our minds, and drawings can help make them stick. Let's go back to how\\nwe use words as labels. I want you to close your eyes\\nfor a second and imagine a tree. Imagine a tree. Got it? Okay. Did your tree, or does\\nyour tree, look like this? Or like this? Or maybe even like that? Probably not. I bet each and everyone of you\\nhas a different tree in mind right now. Because the word tree is a public\\nplaceholder for all sorts of trees. Now, you could say,\\n'Okay, these imaginations, these personal imaginations that we have\\nare different for everyone of us, so they're useless for communication. We should focus on the word,\\nthe common ground.' And I would say,\\n'If we do that, we're missing out.' The problem with words\\nand why it's so hard to anchor them is it's hard to relate them\\nto personal experiences. Now, a drawing can build a bridge between the personal experience of a tree\\nand the abstract expression of it - the word, the conventional word. And it's crucial that this drawing\\nis unconventional, specific, and personal. Let's have a look at a very conventional\\nillustration of an idea first that keeps haunting flip charts\\nall over the world: the light bulb. I would argue the light bulb\\nis very much on the conventional side. It's a mere substitute for word. So it doesn't add\\nany nutritional value, really. If, on the other hand, we have\\na specific personal illustration, then that can supplement\\nwhat we say with our words. So if you want to convey\\nan idea with your words, you can help make it stick\\nwith an image or a drawing. And the fact that this drawing\\nis very personal is not a problem; this is actually where its power lies. Because you can lead other people\\nthrough your personal expression to connect them and understand\\nyour general ideas. And for that to happen, these drawings\\nhave to be as original as our words. Okay, these are just five ways how drawing can support your thinking: it can ignite our intuition, make our lives more beautiful, help us understand, imagine new things,\\nand share them with others. If you make drawing a daily habit, it will be a dramatic\\nimprovement for your thinking. And please remember: Our drawings do not have\\nto be pieces of art. If they help us to think\\nand connect with others, they are good enough. Thank you. (Applause)\", 'Transcriber: Take A Mile\\nReviewer: Mile Živković Good afternoon. I am Mallence, and I come\\nfrom the richest country in the world. It is located in the richest\\ncontinent in the world, in the West of the richest continent. My country is called Sierra Leone. On the surface we are blessed\\nwith infinite beauty and abundance of flora and fauna, producing the most exquisite\\nharvests of coffee, cocoa, fruits, vegetables and caoutchouc. You name it, we’ve got it. We also have diverse wildlife\\nand vast marine resources, and waterfalls, and rivers that run\\ninto the most beautiful beaches. The land is golden;\\nliterally, a true paradise, which of course is inhabited\\nby the most beautiful souls. We have a very strong cultural heritage. In fact, Sierra Leone had the first\\nsub-Saharan university. Prior to that there was one\\nin the kingdom of Timbuktu, which was the first\\nuniversity in the world, succeeding the great Gnostic\\nschools of Egypt and Osiris. On a deeper level, we are blessed with the real treasures\\nthe kings and queens of this world desire. This was the largest\\nalluvial diamond ever found. It weighs almost a thousand carats,\\n969 to be precise. This beauty was found by an old lady\\nin her backyard about 2 years ago. 125 carats. Some people mine gold in their backyards.\\nThat’s quite common. Besides gold and diamonds, we have about 20 precious minerals\\nthat have been discovered as of today. We recently started extracting\\nhuge petroleum reserves that have been discovered. We have platinum, ilmenite to make titanium,\\nrutile to coat jets, iron ore, the largest iron ore deposits in Africa,\\nthe third largest in the world. Tantalite, also known as coltan, used\\nin your mobile phones and computers. Bauxite for aluminum production, zinc, chrome ore, copper, coal,\\nphosphates, potassium, salt, lead, granite, asbestos, nickel, zircon. Furthermore, we have exquisite timber,\\nlike mahogany and teak. And we have the most beautiful\\nstamps in the world. (Laughter) Of course the West needs\\nAfrica’s resources, most desperately, to power airplanes, cell phones,\\ncomputers and engines. And the gold and diamonds of course: a status symbol, to determine\\ntheir powers by decor, and to give value to their currencies. One thing that keeps me puzzled, despite\\nhaving studied finance and economics at the world’s best universities, the following question remains unanswered: Why is it that 5,000 units of our currency\\nis worth one unit of your currency, when we are the ones\\nwith the actual gold reserves? It’s quite evident that the aid is in fact\\nnot coming from the West to Africa, but from Africa to the Western world. The Western world depends on Africa\\nin every possible way, since alternative resources\\nare scarce out here. So how does the West ensure\\nthat the free aid keeps coming? By systematically destabilizing\\nthe wealthiest African nations and their systems, and all that backed by huge PR campaigns, leaving the entire world\\nunder the impression that Africa is poor and dying, and merely surviving\\non the mercy of the West. Well done, Oxfam, UNICEF,\\nRed Cross, Life Aid, and all the other organizations that continuously run multimillion-dollar\\nadvertisement campaigns depicting charity porn, to sustain\\nthat image of Africa, globally. Ad campaigns paid for by innocent people under the impression to help\\nwith their donations. While one hand gives under\\nthe flashing lights of cameras, the other takes, in the shadows. We all know the dollar is worthless, while the euro is merely charged\\nwith German intellect and technology, and maybe some Italian pasta. How can one expect donations\\nfrom nations that have so little? It’s super sweet of you\\nto come with your colored paper in exchange for our gold and diamonds. But instead, you should come empty-handed, filled with integrity and honor. We want to share with you our wealth\\nand invite you to share with us. The perception is\\nthat a healthy and striving Africa would not disperse its resources\\nas freely and cheaply, which is logical. Of course. It would instead sell its resources\\nat world market prices, which in turn would destabilize\\nand weaken Western economies, established on the post-colonial\\nfree-meal system. Last year, the IMF reports that six out of ten of the world\\'s\\nfastest growing economies are in Africa, measured by their GDP growth. The French treasury, for example, is receiving about 500 billion dollars, year in, year out, in foreign exchange\\nreserves from African countries based on colonial debt\\nthey forced them to pay. Former French president Jacques Chirac\\nstated in an interview recently that we have to be honest and acknowledge\\nthat a big part of the money in our banks comes precisely from the exploitation\\nof the African continent. In 2008, he stated that without Africa, France will slide down\\nin the rank of a Third World power. This is what happens in the human world.\\nIn the world we have created. Have you ever wondered\\nhow things work in nature? One would assume that in evolution\\nthe fittest survives. However in nature,\\nany species that is overhunting, overexploiting the resources\\nthey depend on as nourishment, natural selection would sooner\\nor later take the predator out, because it offsets the balance. Now that I shared my perspective with you, I would like to share\\nmy initiatives with you. As a Sierra Leonean,\\nI am a diamond expert. I find them in the rough. What nature created\\nfrom the darkest substance, under the influence of heat and pressure, transforms into the strongest,\\nmost brilliant rocks. These rocks have the consistency\\nto sustain an entire nation. These will be our future leaders. Please meet the FOLORUNSHO\\ncreative collective I formed with 21 street kids\\nthat were orphaned and displaced as a result of the Sierra\\nLeonean civil war, and ended up living in the street\\nas early as age 3, growing up as outlaws of society. (Video) \"My name is Timothy.\\nBut my gangster name is A Fame.\" \"I\\'m Donald Williams\\nbut my nick name is Wanee.\" \"My name is Patrick Christian Kargbo.\" \"My name is Allusine Jalloh.\"\\n\"My name\\'s Momoh Alpha Kamara.\" \"My name is Lamin Bangura. But in the streets\\nthey call me Crazy Exhibit.\" \"My name is Sahr Morsay.\" \"My name is Sheku Conteh.\\nIn the streets they call me DMX.\" (Music) \"I lost my mother and father\\nduring the civil war in Sierra Leone. I was brought up by my\\ngrandmother in the village.\" \"At the age of 5 years, my stepmother maltreated me, she even put poison into my food.\" \"In Jesus name I pray, amen.\\nThis is the story of my life.\" \"We were the ones that formed Lion Base. We were the first ones\\nto lock the place down, till other gangsters came after some time. Now Lion Base is fearful.\\nIt is a fearful crew.\" \"You have the hard way and the soft way. The soft way is to steal. The hard way is to carry load\\nfor people at Dorfcourt or to collect people’s rubbish.\" \"If you are not strong in the streets, you will die at a young age\\nor you\\'re going to end up bad.\" \"2001 when I came into the streets\\nI used to do a lot of bad stuff. I stole, I used to steal people’s\\nphones, I used to live a bad life, till 2010 when I met Mallence.\" \"From the streets she took me\\nand put me into a school. I live good, now. Then my own thing that I want to do\\nin the future is to study law. I always had that determination\\nto become a lawyer. This is my future.\" (Music) \"My future plan is to be able\\nto afford my own family. Because I\\'ve now decided to go to school\\nto be an international business man.\" \"The rough life some of my fellows\\nin the streets are living, I wish they would\\nor could change like me.\" \"Leave the bad lifestyle behind, because this is not how human beings\\nare supposed to live. Human beings are supposed to reason, and wish for a better future\\nin this world.\" (Music) \"It’s not about charity.\\nIt’s all about sharing!\" (Applause) These guys are my biggest inspiration.\\nDestiny brought us together. I met them by a chance encounter in 2010. In 2011 they all started\\nliving with me, 21 in number. Wonderful things happen\\nwhen creatives meet with mutual respect. How did we go about it? Creativity; that same creativity\\nthat ensured their survival under the most adverse\\ncircumstances in the streets is channeled into outlets such as art, music, film and fashion. They made the impossible possible. From Lion Base in Sierra Leone to luxury fashion stores\\nin Paris, New York and Berlin. This is what we created single-handedly,\\nwithout a single cent in donations, without running water,\\nwithout electricity, most of them not being able to read\\nand write at the time when I met them. And now some of them are studying law, engineering, being filmmakers, and so on. This is made with pure energy,\\ninspiration and love in Freetown. With creativity and passion\\nas the sole ingredient, we participate in a global market\\nof international competition and find our way into the world’s\\nmost exclusive department stores, onto the bodies\\nof the world’s fashion icons, and into the most distinguished\\nart collections and exhibitions in Berlin, Paris, New York, Miami. A proven concept that produced\\nself sufficient individuals, financing their own education\\ninto lawyers, engineers, filmmakers and artists,\\nwithin only three years. A concept based on mutual\\nrespect and sharing, a blueprint that can be replicated\\nanywhere, under any circumstances. I only had the vision and the insight\\nto recognize diamonds in the rough, and was determined to prove to the world that the absence of donation produces\\nquality in a self-sufficient manner. I believe charity merely creates\\ninferiority and dependency. I want to serve as a bridge\\nbetween two worlds I call home, to facilitate a fair exchange\\nbetween two contrasting worlds that become powerful\\nonce balance is reinstalled. It’s not about charity,\\nit’s about sharity. Today I invite you\\nto change your perspective. Own your visions of a brighter world. Never see lack, see abundance,\\nalways, everywhere, and watch the universe conspire. Don’t focus on problems\\nbut on the solution. Remember our perception\\nof any given situation is the only thing\\nthat determines the outcome. I am Mallence. I am German, too. Change your channel. (In German) Thank you for your attention. Thank you for listening. (Applause)', \"Transcriber: Susana González\\nReviewer: Keira White (applause) Learning a foreign language\\nis good for you for so many reasons. Why should I learn English? It’s not a question people ask themselves\\na lot these days, is it? English is probably going to become the world’s lingua franca,\\nif it’s not already. Today, English is the most\\nwidely used language for newspaper, book and scientific publishing,\\ninternational telecommunications, international trade, mass entertainment,\\ndiplomacy, and, of course, the Internet. There are now more than 8,000 courses\\ntaught completely in English by leading universities\\nin non-English speaking countries. So for people like me, non-native English speakers, it would seem that if we want\\nto keep up with the world, learning at least one foreign language,\\nnamely English, is a must. We learn it to find a good job, to be more successful,\\nor even to immigrate. I’ve been learning English\\nsince I was little. At first it was my parents who taught me\\nwhich is kind of funny because neither of them\\nspoke any English back then, and they have successfully avoided\\nlearning it for the past 25 years. In fact, when I got\\nmy bachelor’s degree in linguistics, my mom said: ″Good job, honey,\\nwhat’s next for you?″ ″Are you now going to get a real degree?″ After my studies\\nI worked as an English teacher, and whenever I taught\\nan introductory class, I would ask my students: ″Why do you want\\nto learn a foreign language?″ The answers I would usually get\\nwere more or less similar, but before I share them, I would like\\nto ask you to go back for a moment. Think of a time you first started\\nlearning a foreign language, Do you remember why? The answers my students would give were: ″My parents make me″, ″I want to understand\\nsocial media content″, ″I want to travel″,\\n″I want to get a good job″, and a lot of people also acknowledged that learning a language\\nis good for you in general. But if we stop and think about it,\\nwork, travel, good marks at school, watching films, are all amazing,\\nnoble reasons to learn a foreign language, but can you get all that\\nwithout actually learning? I think we probably can. If we go along with this idea, it takes only a little thought\\nto grasp what you can actually do, even if you don’t understand a word\\nin English or any other foreign language. For example, with the technology we have today, software can\\ntranslate a whole web page into your native language\\nin a split second. There are apps that can translate almost any text captured\\nby your smartphone camera in real time, and most media are served to you\\nwith subtitles or a voiceover, available almost immediately\\nafter the recording is made. Not to mention those lucky enough to be born into English-speaking families. They should be fine, right? And, here we come back to this vague ″Learning a language is good for you!″ And it is! It can bring many benefits, including those that can improve the quality of your life\\nand indeed your health. Which is a nice bonus for those of us who started learning it\\nfor something else. It’s like when you buy\\na pack of breakfast cereal, and ″here’s a free sticker inside!″ Let’s move on now, and take a closer look\\nat some of these benefits. I like to visualize concepts, it helps me give form to abstract ideas\\nand make them more simple. I like to imagine\\nevery person as a musician. Let’s start with somebody\\nwho can only speak one language, you probably even know someone like that. Can you picture them in your mind's eye? Let’s assume that this person was born\\nand raised in their native country, they have been able to get by with their native language,\\nbe it for work, travel and leisure. Now, if we visualize some more \\nand give this person an instrument, in some sense we can compare\\ntheir brain to a music box. Now, how does the box work? You spin the handle and magic happens, beautiful, does the trick. But the thing about the box\\nis that it can only play one tune; the mechanism is kind of embedded into the box, so changing it\\nis a lot of work. You repeat one and the same movement all over again. Now, we have bilinguals, in comparison to monolinguals, they have twice as many choices\\non how to deliver an idea, but it’s not that simple. When bilinguals use the target language, they actually activate\\nboth languages that they know. It means that there is always\\nthis competition going on in their heads between the two languages. They have to be constantly ready\\nto respond in one language and suppress the other one. Instead of a music box, I would give them\\na tape recorder and two tapes. Not quite an instrument,\\nbut it can play music too. Now, if you’re bilingual,\\nyour native tape is the one you know best. Depending on how well\\nyou know your second language, the other one could be secondary. So each time you need\\nto play a word or a phrase, it takes you time\\nto get the native tape out, insert the other one, and then find the word\\nor phrase that you’re looking for. In addition to that, you sometimes\\nforget where exactly it is, or even if this word is even on the tape. Each time there is this switch\\nbetween these mental tapes, it takes you mental effort. It’s an exercise, and like with all exercises, it gets easier and easier\\nthe more you do it, until you know the tape inside out. And with each new language, your musical instrument\\ngets more elaborate, like adding new keys to a piano. Some of them you know better, some worse, but each time you switch,\\nyou get more fluent, and as you learn\\nanother third, fourth language, you pick it up faster. You understand the logic\\nthe languages might share, and you are more likely to overcome the barriers to speaking\\nwith your next foreign language. And that mental effort translates\\nonto the other areas of your life, it opens your mind\\nfor greater opportunities, and prepares you for possible challenges. And, that is not only true for those who started\\nlearning a language early in life. That’s right! You can pick up\\na new language today and start enjoying\\nall the amazing benefits it brings. It can even influence\\nyour life indirectly, opening new paths for you. In 2020, like many others, I found myself in quarantine, my boyfriend, my cat and I\\nin a tiny one- room apartment for several months. I figured I needed\\na new hobby to stay sane. It needed to be a one-person indoor hobby, and it needed to be cheap. So I decided I would start\\nlearning a new language. I didn't have a preference. So I did several rounds\\nof flipping a coin, and it turned out to be Finnish. I armed myself with YouTube videos\\nand learning apps, and soon enough, I learned some stuff about some Finnish delicacies, some Finnish towns,\\none famous Finnish poet. Having this tiny connection to the culture\\nmade me want to dig deeper, and before I even realized it, it’s December, and I’m applying to study at a Finnish University. What started small, \\nbecame this huge change that helped me out of depression\\nand gave me purpose. Our brains are picky, our brains love new things; it gives us that handsome \\nreward of dopamine in exchange for novelty, that’s why I have so many pairs of shoes. Usually when you learn something new, the brain-boosting benefits decrease as soon as you get your eureka moment. For example, you want\\nto learn to ride a bicycle; you start trying, you go,\\nand it feels great, but, as soon as you get the hang of it,\\nit’s not the same satisfaction-wise. It’s just going. But that doesn’t happen\\nwhen you learn a foreign language. Instead, your brain needs to keep working, constantly plan, concentrate\\nand make decisions, every day is a school day, it never ends, which to me,\\ncan be both amazing and frustrating. I have been learning English for ages. I have been teaching it\\nas a second language for several years, and I still make mistakes. And there are still words\\nthat I don’t know. Not so long ago,\\nI was watching some British TV and I saw the word ″satsuma″ in a joke. Of course I didn’t get the joke.\\nI’d never heard nor seen this word before. At that moment, I felt almost angry\\nat all the English people who decided to adopt\\nthis word into the language just to make my life more difficult. But, I did make a mental note; apparently, it’s a kind of fruit\\nlike a mandarin or tangerine. I can never tell\\nthe difference between them, because in my native language,\\nwe have one word to describe all three. Later, I was abroad in a supermarket\\nand I saw this sign: ″satsuma″. I pointed to it and I said out loud,\\nthere were people around me, ″You little piece of fruit. I know you″ and it felt really good. Our brains like to be proud, we like achievement,\\nwe like to be the best, and this is the best kind of achievement\\nbecause it’s not competitive. The only person you are trying\\nto out-best is you, and each new word, phrase\\nand sentence brings you victory. It doesn't have to be a big victory. It can be as small as understanding\\na joke in a foreign language. It’s never too early to learn, and it’s never too late. Thank you. (Applause)\", 'I love learning foreign languages. In fact, I love it so much that I like\\nto learn a new language every two years, currently working on my eighth one. When people find that out about me,\\nthey always ask me, \"How do you do that? What\\'s your secret?\" And to be honest, for many years,\\nmy answer would be, \"I don\\'t know. I simply\\nlove learning languages.\" But people were never\\nhappy with that answer. They wanted to know why they are spending\\nyears trying to learn even one language, never achieving fluency, and here I come, learning\\none language after another. They wanted to know\\nthe secret of polyglots, people who speak a lot of languages. And that made me wonder, too, how do actually other polyglots do it? What do we have in common? And what is it that enables us to learn languages\\nso much faster than other people? I decided to meet other people\\nlike me and find that out. The best place to meet a lot of polyglots is an event where hundreds\\nof language lovers meet in one place\\nto practice their languages. There are several such polyglot events\\norganized all around the world, and so I decided to go there and ask polyglots\\nabout the methods that they use. And so I met Benny from Ireland, who told me that his method\\nis to start speaking from day one. He learns a few phrases\\nfrom a travel phrasebook and goes to meet native speakers and starts having conversations\\nwith them right away. He doesn\\'t mind making\\neven 200 mistakes a day, because that\\'s how he learns,\\nbased on the feedback. And the best thing is, he doesn\\'t\\neven need to travel a lot today, because you can easily have\\nconversations with native speakers from the comfort of\\nyour living room, using websites. I also met Lucas from Brazil who had a really interesting\\nmethod to learn Russian. He simply added a hundred random\\nRussian speakers on Skype as friends, and then he opened\\na chat window with one of them and wrote \"Hi\" in Russian. And the person replied, \"Hi, how are you?\" Lucas copied this and put it\\ninto a text window with another person, and the person replied,\\n\"I\\'m fine, thank you, and how are you?\" Lucas copied this\\nback to the first person, and in this way, he had two strangers\\nhave a conversation with each other without knowing about it. (Laughter) And soon he would start typing himself, because he had so many\\nof these conversations that he figured out how\\nthe Russian conversation usually starts. What an ingenious method, right? And then I met polyglots who always start\\nby imitating sounds of the language, and others who always learn the 500\\nmost frequent words of the language, and yet others who always start\\nby reading about the grammar. If I asked a hundred different polyglots, I heard a hundred different\\napproaches to learning languages. Everybody seems to have a unique way\\nthey learn a language, and yet we all come to the same result\\nof speaking several languages fluently. And as I was listening to these polyglots\\ntelling me about their methods, it suddenly dawned on me: the one thing we all have in common is that we simply found ways to enjoy\\nthe language-learning process. All of these polyglots\\nwere talking about language learning as if it was great fun. You should have seen their faces when they were showing me\\ntheir colorful grammar charts and their carefully handmade flash cards, and their statistics\\nabout learning vocabulary using apps, or even how they love to cook\\nbased on recipes in a foreign language. All of them use different methods, but they always make sure\\nit\\'s something that they personally enjoy. I realized that this is actually\\nhow I learn languages myself. When I was learning Spanish,\\nI was bored with the text in the textbook. I mean, who wants to read about Jose asking about the directions\\nto the train station. Right? I wanted to read \"Harry Potter\" instead, because that was\\nmy favorite book as a child, and I have read it many times. So I got the Spanish translation\\nof \"Harry Potter\" and started reading, and sure enough, I didn\\'t understand\\nalmost anything at the beginning, but I kept on reading\\nbecause I loved the book, and by the end of the book, I was able\\nto follow it almost without any problems. And the same thing happened\\nwhen I was learning German. I decided to watch \"Friends,\"\\nmy favorite sitcom, in German, and again, at the beginning\\nit was all just gibberish. I didn\\'t know where one word finished\\nand another one started, but I kept on watching every day\\nbecause it\\'s \"Friends.\" I can watch it in any language.\\nI love it so much. And after the second or third season, seriously, the dialogue\\nstarted to make sense. I only realized this\\nafter meeting other polyglots. We are no geniuses and we have no shortcut\\nto learning languages. We simply found ways\\nhow to enjoy the process, how to turn language learning\\nfrom a boring school subject into a pleasant activity\\nwhich you don\\'t mind doing every day. If you don\\'t like writing\\nwords down on paper, you can always type them in an app. If you don\\'t like listening\\nto boring textbook material, find interesting content on YouTube\\nor in podcasts for any language. If you\\'re a more introverted person and you can\\'t imagine speaking\\nto native speakers right away, you can apply the method of self-talk. You can talk to yourself\\nin the comfort of your room, describing your plans for the weekend,\\nhow your day has been, or even take a random\\npicture from your phone and describe the picture\\nto your imaginary friend. This is how polyglots learn languages, and the best news is,\\nit\\'s available to anyone who is willing to take the learning\\ninto their own hands. So meeting other polyglots\\nhelped me realize that it is really crucial\\nto find enjoyment in the process of learning languages, but also that joy in itself is not enough. If you want to achieve fluency\\nin a foreign language, you\\'ll also need to apply\\nthree more principles. First of all, you\\'ll need\\neffective methods. If you try to memorize a list of words\\nfor a test tomorrow, the words will be stored\\nin your short-term memory and you\\'ll forget them after a few days. If you, however,\\nwant to keep words long term, you need to revise them\\nin the course of a few days repeatedly using the so-called space repetition. You can use apps which are based\\non this system such as Anki or Memrise, or you can write lists of word\\nin a notebook using the Goldlist method, which is also very popular\\nwith many polyglots. If you\\'re not sure which methods are\\neffective and what is available out there, just check out polyglots\\'\\nYouTube channels and websites and get inspiration from them. If it works for them,\\nit will most probably work for you too. The third principle to follow is to create a system in your learning. We\\'re all very busy and no one\\nreally has time to learn a language today. But we can create that time\\nif we just plan a bit ahead. Can you wake up 15 minutes earlier\\nthan you normally do? That would be the perfect time\\nto revise some vocabulary. Can you listen to a podcast\\non your way to work while driving? Well, that would be great\\nto get some listening experience. There are so many things we can do\\nwithout even planning that extra time, such as listening to podcasts\\non our way to work or doing our household chores. The important thing is\\nto create a plan in the learning. \"I will practice speaking\\nevery Tuesday and Thursday with a friend for 20 minutes. I will listen to a YouTube video\\nwhile having breakfast.\" If you create a system in your learning, you don\\'t need to find that extra time, because it will become\\na part of your everyday life. And finally, if you want to learn\\na language fluently, you need also a bit of patience. It\\'s not possible to learn\\na language within two months, but it\\'s definitely possible to make\\na visible improvement in two months, if you learn in small chunks every day\\nin a way that you enjoy. And there is nothing\\nthat motivates us more than our own success. I vividly remember the moment when I understood the first joke\\nin German when watching \"Friends.\" I was so happy and motivated that I just kept on watching that day\\ntwo more episodes, and as I kept watching, I had more and more of those moments\\nof understanding, these little victories, and step by step, I got to a level\\nwhere I could use the language freely and fluently to express anything. This is a wonderful feeling. I can\\'t get enough of that feeling, and that\\'s why I learn\\na language every two years. So this is the whole polyglot secret. Find effective methods\\nwhich you can use systematically over the period of some time\\nin a way which you enjoy, and this is how polyglots learn\\nlanguages within months, not years. Now, some of you may be thinking, \"That\\'s all very nice\\nto enjoy language learning, but isn\\'t the real secret\\nthat you polyglots are just super talented\\nand most of us aren\\'t?\" Well, there\\'s one thing\\nI haven\\'t told you about Benny and Lucas. Benny had 11 years of Irish Gaelic\\nand five years of German at school. He couldn\\'t speak them\\nat all when graduating. Up to the age of 21, he thought\\nhe didn\\'t have the language gene and he could not speak another language. Then he started to look\\nfor his way of learning languages, which was speaking to native speakers\\nand getting feedback from them, and today Benny can easily\\nhave a conversation in 10 languages. Lucas tried to learn English\\nat school for 10 years. He was one of the worst students in class. His friends even made fun of him and gave him a Russian textbook as a joke because they thought he would never\\nlearn that language, or any language. And then Lucas started\\nto experiment with methods, looking for his own way to learn, for example, by having Skype chat\\nconversations with strangers. And after just 10 years, Lucas is able to speak\\n11 languages fluently. Does that sound like a miracle? Well, I see such miracles\\nevery single day. As a language mentor, I help people learn\\nlanguages by themselves, and I see this every day. People struggle with language learning\\nfor five, 10, even 20 years, and then they suddenly take\\ntheir learning into their own hands, start using materials which they enjoy,\\nmore effective methods, or they start tracking their learning so that they can appreciate\\ntheir own progress, and that\\'s when suddenly they magically find the language talent\\nthat they were missing all their lives. So if you\\'ve also tried\\nto learn a language and you gave up,\\nthinking it\\'s too difficult or you don\\'t have the language talent, give it another try. Maybe you\\'re also\\njust one enjoyable method away from learning that language fluently. Maybe you\\'re just one method away\\nfrom becoming a polyglot. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Transcriber: Наталья Овчинникова\\nReviewer: Adrienne Lin I speak seven languages. As soon as people find out about that, what I\\'m most often asked -- other than for my phone number -- is: \"How did you do it? How did you go about learning\\nall these different languages?\" Well, today I\\'m going to\\nshare with you some answers. So my phone number is 212... (Laughter) I\\'m just kidding. See, I was raised as a polyglot. And by the time I turned 18, I could speak already\\nfour different languages. And then for the subsequent three years, I learned three additional languages. It\\'s about those 3 years\\nthat I want to talk about. Because my language acquisition process was very different from that of my peers, in that it was never of these stressful, strenuous, difficult,\\nseemingly impossible tasks, but rather something\\nenjoyable, fun, exciting. I loved it, every single moment of it. And I want to share with you why, what was it that made it so special. See, I did have a head start, in that I did have these four languages\\nthat I spoke ahead of time. But there were also these 5 techniques, 5 skills if you will, that I use that made the language\\nlearning process so much easier. And it\\'s about those 5 techniques that I want to talk about. So let\\'s dig right in. And for the first one, the first thing that we\\'ve got to do is to take a very deep breath. And relax. And the reason for it\\nis because our entire lives, we\\'re taught how to do things right. From the moment we were born we\\'re taught what things we should do,\\nthings we shouldn\\'t do, and how to do things properly. Well, when it comes to language learning, the golden rule of language learning, the most important thing, is to get things wrong, to make mistakes, and that is the first rule. Let me explain to you why. See, when we\\'ve known languages, we know a whole collection of sounds and a whole collection of structures, which combined make what I like to call -- and for the purpose\\nof this presentation -- our \"\\'language database.\" And our language database will contain all the sounds and structures\\nthat we know. However, there is a whole family\\nof sounds and structures that are beyond our database. And for us to be able to embark on those\\nand to be able to explore those, there is nothing within our database, nothing within our knowledge that will tell us when\\nwe\\'re getting the structures right, nothing to tell us\\nwhen that sound is precise. Let\\'s say we\\'re going to explore\\nthis one specific sound. There is nothing in our database. When we say it, we could say it perfectly, but in our minds,\\nit will sound like a mistake. So you know that queasy feeling,\\nthat insecure thing, when we feel like we\\'re doing\\nsomething wrong? That is the trigger\\nthat you need to look for. Because that is the signal that tells you\\nthat you\\'re going beyond your database and that you\\'re allowing yourself\\nto explore the realm of the new language. Let me show you how\\nthis works in practice. Let\\'s say, we\\'re going to go\\nand learn the word \"door\" in Spanish. So, the word \"door\"\\nin Spanish is \"Puerta.\" So, for \"Puerta\" we\\'ve got\\na few sounds that exist in English. So, the \"Pu,\" \"e,\" and \"ta.\" However, when it comes to the \"r,\" that sound is not in our database. The \"RR.\" The rolled \"r\" does not exist\\nin the English sound database. And it\\'s a little bit on the outside. So, if we allowed ourselves to bridge through our database,\\nand to really break through and to make the mistake, we could make sounds like the \"RR.\" But instead, what sometimes happens is that we get the closest relative of it\\nthat is within the database, and that is the \"ah-er\" sound. (Laughter) And that \"ah-er\" sound makes something\\nthat sounds like \"pue-er-rta,\" which doesn\\'t mean a thing in Spanish, and actually doesn\\'t sound too charming. And it doesn\\'t tell you too much. So, for the first technique, allow yourself to make that mistake, so that sounds like \"Puerta\" can come out. And now let\\'s go to the second one. For the second one, I\\'m going to need\\nsome of your collaboration. We\\'re going to read\\nthese four beautiful words. And on the count of three. So let\\'s start with the first one,\\non the count of three: one, two, three. (Audience) Mao.\\nSE: \"Mao,\" perfect. The second one: one, two, three.\\n(Audience:) Coco. SE: Perfect. Third one.\\nOne, two, three. (Audience) Cocao.\\nSE: Perfect. And the fourth one. One, two, three. (Silence) Oh. Let me show you what happened\\nwhen we did this. We get theses four words and we put them through\\na sort of American English filter. And we get something\\nlooks kind of like this. And I\\'ll tell you the results of that. So for the first one \"Mão,\" which means \"hand\" in Portuguese, we put it through the filter,\\nwe get \"Mao.\" (Laughter) For the second one we get \"coco,\" which is \"coconut\" in Portuguese, or \"cocô,\" which means \"poop.\" We put through the filter,\\nwe get a warm cup of cocoa. (Laughter) And for the fourth one, we have \"huo,\" which means \"fire\" in Chinese. And we get -- if you\\'re feeling really creative,\\nmaybe a dude doing karate... (Laughter) But anyway, these don\\'t tell you much\\nabout how these things are pronounced. And if you think it\\'s only one way, only if you\\'re going from English\\nto a different language, think about non-native speakers. And try to explain to someone that this [though] is pronounced \"though,\" and that this [thought]\\nis pronounced \"thought.\" And even though\\nthey look almost identical, they have nothing to do with one another. Or try to explain to them that this [enough] is \"enough\" and this [enuf] is just simply wrong. See, there is nothing useful\\nabout using that foreign alphabet, when you\\'re trying to learn a language. Why? Because it will\\ngive you wrong signals. So what is the second technique? Scrap it. Scrap the foreign alphabet. Let me give you an alternative\\nof how you can go about this. This is a Brazilian currency, and it spelled like this. On the count of three, can we all say\\nthe name of the currency. 1, 2, 3. (Audience) Real. SE: We have some people\\nwho know the spelling. Yeah, \"re-al,\" for the most part. And as useful as this might seem,\\nit doesn\\'t tell you a single thing. And when you\\'re speaking Portuguese,\\n\"re-al\" means nothing. Let me give you an alternative. See, in Portuguese,\\nthe way that you say \"real\" is \"heou.\" So let me teach you how to say it. So on the count of three, let\\'s say \"he.\" So it\\'s \"hey\" without the \"y\" sound. So, one, two, three -- \"he.\" (Audience) HE.\\nSE: Perfect. And now let\\'s say \"ou.\" It\\'s like \"ouch\",\\nbut without the \"ch\" sound, so it\\'s \"ou.\" One, two, three, (Audience) OU.\\nSE: Perfect. So, \"HE.\" (Audience) HE. SE: \"OU.\" (Audience:) OU. SE: \"HE.\"\\n(Audience:) HE. SE: \"OU.\"\\n(Audience:) OU. SE: \"HE-OU,\" HEOU. (Audience) HE-OU.\\nSE: Perfect. Now you all sound like\\npassionate Brazilian capitalists. (Laughter) So why would we go and use\\nsomething that looks like this, that looks like \"real,\" when instead you can use something that looks like this and gives you\\nso much more information about how to say something\\nin a foreign language. And that puts us in a really good spot because at this point we allowed ourselves to break through our database\\nand to make mistakes, to go into that uncharted territory\\nof a new language. And then, we figured out\\nhow to take notations in a way that the information\\nis actually meaningful. But then how can we test it? And that\\'s where\\ntechnique number 3 comes in. Technique number 3\\nis about finding a stickler. So finding someone who\\'s detail-oriented and won\\'t let you to get away\\nwith the mistakes. And more than finding someone\\nwho is really that person, the guru for the language, it\\'s more about establishing\\nthe right sort of relationship. Relationship with someone, where they\\'ll correct you,\\nand feel comfortable correcting you and making sure that you\\'re getting\\nto that spot you wanted in a language. But at the same time, someone who will encourage you to get things wrong and to make\\nthose mistakes in the first place. And sticklers could be your teacher, it could be your tutor, friend, it could be someone on Skype\\nor on Craigslist; it doesn\\'t matter. You can find sticklers all over the place, and with technology,\\nit becomes a lot easier find them. And then it\\'s time to practice. And for practicing,\\nwe\\'ve got the fourth technique. See, I always thought I had this thing that was a little bit\\nof \"Sid craziness\" that I did, and then I realized how useful it was. I always did what I like to call\\n\"Shower Conversations.\" And shower conversations are\\nexactly what they sound like. When I was learning a new language, I would stay in the shower\\nfor a few minutes. I would remember\\nhaving all these discussions; I remember when I was learning Chinese, and I would haggle\\nand try to get two yen more, to get that wonderful dumpling,\\nand getting the discount; or I would go to Roma and I\\'d ask for directions\\nto the best \"piazza.\" It was amazing. The beautiful thing\\nabout the shower conversation is that it allows you to find wherever\\nyou have a gap in your knowledge, because you\\'re having\\na conversation on both ends. For example, it\\'s easy to ask\\nfor directions, how about receiving them? Or even better, giving directions. Well, the shower conversation forces you\\nto have both side of the conversation. And you don\\'t need\\nto have them in the shower. Another wonderful thing\\nis that you can have them anywhere. You can have them in the shower,\\nin your apartment, walking down in the streets,\\nin the subway, and seriously, if you\\'re in the subway, speaking to yourself in a foreign\\nlanguage in New York, you\\'ll fit right in. You\\'re fine. It\\'s great, because you don\\'t depend on anything\\nor anyone to get your practice, and I did this for years. And later on I found\\nthat professional athletes do, too. Michael Phelps is known to visualize\\nevery single one of his races, several times over,\\nbefore jumping in water. Worked great for him, and it works great for me, too, so it would work for you as well. And now let\\'s go to using the language. Because up to now, it\\'s great, we\\'ve figured out\\nhow to do all these things, and that puts us in a really good position\\nto use the language, and for that I recommend\\nyou find a conversation buddy. To find a conversation buddy, I recommend you follow what I call\\n\"The Buddy Formula.\" And that is a way that you can make sure that your incentives are always aligned\\nto use the new language. So for that is, the target language should be\\nyour best language in common. Why? If you\\'re anything like me, you like to learn languages, so that you can communicate\\nwith more people, so that you can reach out and understand a little bit more\\nabout their brains and hearts. And so, if we try to talk to\\nsomeone in a foreign language that both of us don\\'t do really well,\\nwhen we could be speaking English, or whatever language you\\'re\\nmore comfortable with as a pair, odds are that you\\'re going to revert\\nto that language that is easier. So I recommend you to find someone\\nwhere your best language in common is your target language. And if you can\\'t find one locally,\\ntry technology. Or if you can travel,\\nthat would be perfect. There\\'s a problem with that,\\nand I realize it, because it\\'s difficult to find someone\\nwho fits that profile exactly. But I\\'ve got good news. And I\\'ve found that out when I was work, and one of my colleagues,\\nhe\\'s a linguist, too, he speaks a ton of languages, and our best language in common\\nwas definitely English. Our second best language in common:\\ndefinitely French. But we always spoke in German\\nto each other in the office. Why was that? It was because there were people\\nin the office who spoke English; there were people in the office\\nwho spoke French. But we could talk about Friday\\nand Saturday night in German, and nobody had any idea\\nwhat we were talking about. So it can also be your best\\nsecret language in common. (Laughter) And it becomes such a convenient tool. You can have it with your friends and you get the sense of privacy\\nin public. No matter where you are,\\nyou can have a private conversation. So, let\\'s recap. With the first technique we allow ourselves to break\\nthrough the barrier of language and to explore the uncharted territory of sounds and structures\\noutside our database. Then with the second one, we learn how to take notes and how to make sure\\nthat we can take notes in a way that we can replicate\\nthose sounds and structures later. Then we can check the mistakes\\nby finding a stickler. Fourth: Practice. Have shower conversations,\\nwherever you want to be. And then, follow the Buddy Formula, and you can find somebody\\nto practice your language with. And after that, (Italian) we get to\\na truly beautiful place, (German) where learning languages is no longer something stressful,\\ndifficult and boring, (Spanish) but rather\\na world of possibilities. A world, where each of us\\nhas the opportunity to explore (French) new cultures and\\nall the different ways of living. (Br. Portuguese)\\nThe greatest reward from this, is that we end up learning\\nmore about ourselves. (Greek) As of now,\\nit may all sound Greek for you. But that doesn\\'t mean\\nthat you can\\'t learn it. (Mandarin Chinese)\\n\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.\" (English) And this is not a problem,\\nbecause now you know how to walk. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Transcriber: Herald Park\\nReviewer: Nguyen Nguyen The Hey Hey guys, I\\'m Tom from Croatia, \\nand for the last couple of years, the world has been my home. I travelled, I hitchhiked in cars,\\ntrucks, horses, motorcycles, boats. I drove in buses, trains, \\nrickshaws. I worked all kinds of jobs, \\nspent time with locals, I volunteered, and became a monk\\n-just kidding. I sailed across the Indian Ocean,\\nI tried things that I never tried before. I\\'ve seen things that I will \\nremember as long as I live. and all that with almost no money. (Applause) That\\'s pretty much it actually,\\nthank you very much. (Laughter) Most of the people when they see \\nthis video, they react with, \"Wow! I wish I could travel like that.\" The thing is, most of us actually can.\\nBefore I started travelling, as Andrew said, I was a stockbroker, \\nworking 9-5, had a lot of money. and then the crash came 2008, \\nI lost my job, I lost the money, and I lost the meaning. At that time, I discovered a website\\ncalled Couchsurfing. I don\\'t know how many of you guys \\nheard about Couchsurfing? Ok, how many of you haven\\'t \\nheard about Couchsurfing? Ok, for you guys, it\\'s an internet website\\nthat allows you to host travellers in your own home, and at the same time \\nit allows you to stay in other people\\'s homes\\nwhile you\\'re travelling yourself. When I was hosting people in my \\napartment, over 150 of them, by listening to their stories, and seeing the spark \\nin their eyes, my thought was, \"wow! I wish I could travel like that.\" But I was afraid. The world is a very dangerous place,\\nat least according to the media, our education, \\nour family church, and so on. I was afraid of leaving \\nmy comfort zone, and going, by myself,\\ninto the unknown world. I was also afraid of not having any money,\\nand then the people that I hosted in my apartment told me\\ntwo amazing things. First of all, you don\\'t have to be brave\\nto travel, you just have to have a little bit of courage \\nto start, to leave. And the other thing they told me is \\nthat you don\\'t have to be rich to travel. Actually, all expenses while you\\'re travelling fall into three major categories: first is transportation, \\nto get from point A to point B, the other one is accommodation, \\nand the last is everything else, food, drinks and so on. And they told me if you minimize \\nthose three expenses to some minimum, it can actually be cheaper to travel\\nthan live in your own city. I listened to them, \\nand for the next five years, I\\'ve been travelling\\naround the world, with almost no money. And this is how I did it:\\nfirst thing, I hitchhiked. Apart from being free, \\napart from being really fast, it allowed me one amazing thing,\\nto have an adventure between point A and point B. Now how many of you guys \\nhave ever hitchhiked before? Ok, quite a lot of you, why, \\nwhat are you doing? (Laughter) I\\'m going to play you a short video\\ncalled \"Hitchhiking Guide\", just to tell you a few unwritten rules\\nabout hitchhiking, and some of my experiences. (music playing in background) (laughter) (laughter) (sobbing) (car honks) (applause) Thank you. There are other alternatives\\nto transportation. One of them is walking, \\nyou guys know what that is... How many of you guys know? (Laughter) So, you just take your \\nbackpack and hit the road. Another way is cycling;\\nit\\'s not maybe completely free, because you have to buy the bicycle,\\nand eventually fix it, but it\\'s much cheaper \\nthan the conventional methods of transportation. And the last one is actually \\nworking in exchange for transportation. I did this when I was sailing across\\nthe Indian Ocean from Australia to Africa. And I didn\\'t have to pay for the ride, I \\njust needed to do some work on the boat, like some night watches, \\n\"cooking\" and stuff like that. When it came to accommodation,\\nmost of the time I used Couchsurfing, because I had a lot of experience,\\nhad a lot these positive references on the website and so on. What I like about Couchsurfing the most\\nis not only because it\\'s free, it allows you to have \\na different perspective of the destination. You\\'re not destined to stay in your hotel \\nroom or take the tourist tours. You just hang out with your host\\nhe takes you on places that you would probably never visit \\nby yourself. But also there some other alternatives;\\none of them is camping, you have your tents, you can sleep \\nalmost everywhere you want. In the big cities I usually slept in parks just have my sleeping bag and my mattress. The last one when it comes \\nto accommodation is volunteering. There are a lot of opportunities all \\naround the world that offer you to work in exchange for accommodation, \\nsometimes even food. So you get to sleep \\nin beautiful rooms like this. When it comes to all the other expenses,\\none of them is food, in rich cities and rich countries I usually buy food in supermarkets,\\nwhich is the cheapest way, and just eat on the streets. You can also cook with your host, \\nwhich can be a pretty unique experience. (Laughter)\\nTo say the least These are Germans actually.\\n(Laughter) Sorry, it was pretty delicious\\nto say the least and one of the cheapest. Another thing is dumpster diving;\\nmaybe over 40-50% of the food that is being produced \\nis being thrown away, and a lot of people have a problem with \\nthat, so they go to supermarket bins after the closing hours, \\nand just take all the food that is not going to be sold \\nthe day after. When it comes to drinks, booze you know,\\nthe usual ty to avoid bars, restaurants and to drink in parks. This is how you can travel really really cheaply but one other thing when it comes to travelling is that you can \\nearn money while travelling. How to do that? \\nI did it a couple times. One of them is busking, \\nplaying the guitar on the streets. I\\'m not a musician. I know like probably \\nfour or five chords, and four songs, so it\\'s like repeat all, you know. People are passing by, \\nso they don\\'t really know. (Laughter) The most important thing \\nis to have a story. I always had my small cardboard, which \\nI wrote, actually somebody else wrote in the local language, where I\\'m from,\\nwhat I\\'m doing there, what\\'s my story. I think that\\'s why people donated\\na little bit of money, some sandwiches, sodas, and so on. You won\\'t earn a lot of money \\nby doing this but it can get you through the day. One other way is to write;\\nyou can write a blog, open up a Facebook page. After a while,\\nyou can maybe write a book, and so on. But what brought me largest amount of money is actually going to Australia. This is a job I worked in Australia, \\nI call it \"professional traffic diverter\", it\\'s a very hard job as you can see,\\nyou tell people, \"Please go this way\\nand not this way\" I mean, if they are blind you know.\\n(Laughter) So for this, I was getting paid \\ntwenty dollars an hour. (crowd gasping) I\\'m sorry, I know you hate me,\\nand all that. (Laughter) Oh, well. Plus, I had food and accommodation\\nincluded. I know, I know. Actually, one information, this was \\non my around the world trip, it took me thirteen days \\nof working at this job, to pay off eight months of travelling\\nfrom Croatia through the entire Asia, reaching Australia. So thirteen days of work, in exchange\\nfor eight months of travelling. So, what have I learned on \\nall these trips? Have I found the meaning of life and so \\non. That\\'s what my mom asked me? Like \"Oh, you know we were really scared \\nfor all these years, but was it worth it?\" and my answer is always \"definitely yes\". I\\'ve learned a lot of things, most of them \\nare just like some personal nature things so I won\\'t be talking about that, \\nbut I also learned some general fruits. so to speak I learned not to trust media, \\nand all their \"horror stories\". I learned that we should preserve \\nour earth, like it\\'s the only one we have, and the only one \\nwith chocolate right? I learned to tear down my prejudices,\\nthat was probably one of the most important things. I learned that all the people \\naround the world, no matter how much we try \\nto point out the differences between the cultures, races, \\nreligions, and so on, we\\'re all actually\\nbasically the same. I have a short story about these prejudices \\nthat I encountered while I was travelling. When I was leaving Croatia, \\nheading on my around the world trip, everybody was telling me, \\n\"Be careful, it\\'s very dangerous, you know you\\'re going to hitchhike,\\ngoing to sleep in other people\\'s homes and stuff like that.\" In Croatia, it\\'s still ok to travel, \\nbut as soon as you cross the border, and enter into Serbia...\\nyou know what Serbians are like. Be very very careful, somebody might kill \\nyou. And I\\'m like \"Ok, thank you for the warning\" and I cross the border \\nenter into Serbia, amazing adventures, amazing people I met, people picking me up, taking me out sleeping in their homes, really \\nreally amazing experiences. I was leaving Serbia, heading to Bulgaria,\\nand I was driving with a driver, and telling him that story, like\\nhow Croatians were warning me about Serbians. And he\\'s like, \"Ah brother, you know\\nthat is complete nonsense, Croatians and Serbians, \\nwe are all brothers. But Bulgarians, when you cross the \\nborder, enter into Bulgaria... you know what Bulgarians are like; \\na lots of gypsies, man, you know. Be very careful, somebody might kill you.\"\\n(Laughter) Entering Bulgaria,\\nthe same story all over again. Amazing experiences, \\npeople just extremely friendly. Then I was driving with one truck driver,\\ngoing towards Turkey and I was telling him the same story how Croatians \\nwarned me about Serbians, Serbians about Bulgarians. And he was like, \"Oh brother, \\nthat\\'s complete nonsense, Croatians, Serbians, Bulgarians...\\nwe are all Balkan brothers! But Turkish people, oh my God!\\nYou know what Turkish people are like. Very dangerous, somebody \\nmight kill you.\" Turkish people warned me about\\nKurdish people, Kurdish people about Iranis, Iranis about Pakistanis, \\nPakistanis about Indians, Indians didn\\'t warn me about anyone, I don\\'t know, it\\'s like the last frontier, or something. Beats me, but yeah, it wasn\\'t only\\na travel lesson, but maybe a life lesson like not to trust all these horror stories\\nthat people were telling. And one also interesting thing,\\nwhen you come back home, people are kind of afraid of leaving,\\nbecause they don\\'t know what\\'s going to wait for them \\nonce they come back. There\\'s a big probability \\nyou will be a star. When you come back, \\neverybody will buy you beers, the girls will be like, \"Ooh, you know\\nhe\\'s been travelling!\" (Laughter) But after a while, it kinda gets boring;\\nyou\\'re tired of telling your own story, people are tired of listening to it, and\\nthis post travelling depression kicks in. Then you actually have three options. One of them is to just settle down\\nto your old lifestyle. You still have your old friends, they\\'re still talking about \\nthe same things, going to the same places, \\nmaybe you can get your old job back, and after a while it\\'s ok. You feel safe living there;\\nbut you kind of miss that guy who has been travelling, \\nhaving this intensity wherever he goes. The second option is \\nto take your backpack, and say, \"Oh no, I can\\'t live here\" and \\njust head back to the road. You will have that intensity, \\nyou\\'ll meet amazing people, have adventures every single day. But after a while, you\\'ll miss something;\\nyou\\'ll miss belonging to a story. Your friendships will be intense,\\nbut they will be short-lasting. Your relationships will last as long as \\nyour visa for a certain country. You will miss having a home. The third option is actually\\nthe balance of these two: so stay in one place, \\nbut still don\\'t loose that intensity. Walk in streets you\\'ve never\\nwalked in before, start talking with random people\\non the streets, get a new hobby, find a new job, maybe write a book,\\ngive a TEDx conference talk, you know like all sorts of things. So, is it for everyone, \\nthis type of travelling? I don\\'t think so; \\nwith all the amazing things that this kind of travelling can bring \\nto you, there are also downsides: it\\'s a big chance that you\\'ll be lonely\\nand that you\\'ll be hungry, sick, homesick, but it all comes down \\nto your gut feeling. If after all these ideas, \\nand all these knowledges, you still have that,\\n\"wow, I wish I could travel like this\" then you should definitely do it. Then you should forget about your fears,\\ndisregard the fact that you\\'re broke, and just leave, head to the road. Because like that famous quote says,\\n\"In twenty years from now on, you\\'ll be more disappointed \\nby the things you didn\\'t do, than by the things you did do\". Thank you very much.\\n(Applause)', 'Transcriber: Yunhan Jiang\\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs Good morning. (Ethereal music) It has been quite a privilege being able to grow up\\nin two quite different ways of life. I was born in Germany, and at the same time had the chance to learn more about an ancient art\\ncoming from the Shaolin Temple. When you grow up in an Asian family, it is quite common that firstly, you don\\'t argue\\nwith your father, and secondly, you either\\nbecome medical doctor, engineer, or lawyer. Elsewise your parents\\nwill be very unhappy. So having that said, I finished my academic education\\nwith two university degrees, an MBA, and quite a collection\\nof different certificates and diplomas - everything that my parents thought\\nwould be useful to have. But throughout this education, I felt something was missing. Because I was learning\\nabout many different aspects - how the plant is working, what an atom is made out of, how a political system is functioning, but somehow, the subject was missing to learn something about myself. So with the age of four, for the first time I got introduced\\ninto the monastic practices, and I was very happy to find out\\nthat the main part of these practices were dealing with the exploration\\nand the discovery of yourself. There was mental training, development of behavior\\ncombined with the physical training, all aspects of what nowadays \\nis known as Shaolin Kung-Fu. Now, despite the wishes of my parents to somehow go out in the market\\nand try to manage the world, I decided to continue this monastic life and start learning more\\nabout myself first. Now, in the preparation for this talk, I was asked to share a few words on what is important in this lifetime, and see, it\\'s already challenging to put three decades into a single talk. But the picture I would like to show you summarizes very much what I consider\\nas being valuable in this lifetime. There is something\\nabout sharing with others. There is something about connection. There is the training\\nand development of yourself. It is to enjoy your time,\\neven doing nothing. And one main aspect is to find a way and do the things you like to do. Now, when I received the invitation to have a talk at today\\'s event, especially under the slogan\\n\"High, Higher, Highest,\" something very particular\\ncame up on my mind, and a master from the Shaolin Temple once told me a story\\nthat I would like to share with you. (Flute music) A man was living close to a mountain, and every day he was thinking: How would it be to climb that mountain and what would I see on the peak? So finally, the day came, \\nand the man went on the journey. Arriving at the foot of the mountain, he met the first traveler. So he asked, \"How did you get up the mountain,\\nand what did you see from the top?\" And so the traveler shared his path, and also the view that he had. But then the man was thinking, \"The way that this traveler described\\nto me sounds very exhausting. I need to find another way to climb.\" So he continued to walk\\non the foot of the mountain until he met the next traveler. So once again he asked, \"How did you climb up that mountain, and what did you see from the top?\" And so again the traveler\\nshared his story. Still not being determined\\non which direction and which way to go, the man asked 30 more people,\\n30 more travelers. When he finished talking to all of them, he finally made up his mind. \"Now that so many people\\nalready shared with me their paths and especially what\\nthey all saw from the top, I don\\'t need to climb there anymore.\" It is very unfortunate this man never went on the journey. Now, to conclude this story, firstly, each individual needs to find\\nthe most suitable way to climb that mountain. But secondly, there is information possible to be shared with words, but it is impossible to share the experience of clarity when you are standing\\non that peak by yourself. To invest the right effort in climbing that peak, it\\'s very much what\\nall the Buddhist practices, the Shaolin training, or any spiritual practice is about. Clarity means you see more clear. When you see more clear,\\ninterrelations become more apparent. When you see more clear, there is no need to believe anyone\\nor believe anything. Seeing clear means \\nyou can distinguish for yourself which is the proper direction to take and which decisions do I have to make in order to make my goals\\nor aspirations start to shape? Now, at today\\'s talk,\\nyou will have the chance to become inspired \\nby quite a lot of different travelers. But in this particular talk, I can\\'t, and I won\\'t tell you\\nwhich way to go. It\\'s just that along\\nyour personal journey, you will encounter challenges. Those challenges will either prevent you, or some of them even stop you, from moving on and climbing that mountain. In the Shaolin Temple,\\nwe refer to them as \"the five hindrances.\" The five hindrances are describing\\ndifferent states of the mind. In those states of the mind, it becomes very hard to see clearly and therefore engage\\nin the right decisions. The first hindrance\\nis called \"sensual desire.\" Sensual desire arises in the moment when you are paying\\nattention to something that is giving you a positive emotion. This positive emotion can originate\\nfrom five gates of your body: Seeing, hearing, smelling,\\ntasting, or feeling. So in your mind,\\nyou climb up that mountain. After one mile of walking, you discover a beautiful restaurant surrounded by beautiful people. You smell delicious food\\nand the great variety of beverages. When you follow that temptation, you have already lost your track. When this temptation becomes so strong that you don\\'t want\\nto leave that place anymore, then the sensual desire\\nhas turned into an obsession. In both cases, remaining at that place means\\nthat you can\\'t get clarity. The second hindrance, \"ill-will,\" describes the state of the mind that arises from negative emotions. In that state of the mind, you have an aversion,\\na rejection, or simply a dislike against either an object, a situation,\\nor can be even a person. To simplify, it means: You are climbing the mountain, and it starts to rain, but you don\\'t like rain. You discover the roads are bumpy, but you don\\'t like bumpy roads. In order to cross the river,\\nyou need to swim, but you don’t like swimming. Whatever it is that you dislike, it won’t make it a pleasant journey unless you learn\\nto let go of this ill-will. It’s more likely even\\nthat you won\\'t continue that journey. The third hindrance originally\\ntranslated as \"sloth and torpor.\" \"Sloth\" means it’s\\nthe heaviness of the body. \"Torpor\" means it’s\\nthe dullness of the mind. It is characterized by sleepiness, non-motivation, lack of energy, and oftentimes can manifest itself in a state of depression. Now, a simile used in Buddhism\\ndescribes it as \"imprisonment.\" You find yourself locked in a cell. It becomes very hard to make any type\\nof mental or physical effort. So in order to continue your path, there is only one option left. You need to find a way to get out\\nfrom that hole, from that cell. Now, the fourth hindrance\\nis called \"restlessness.\" It is the state of an unsettled mind. \"Unsettle mind\" means\\nyour mind cannot settle. (Laughter)\\nSettle where? Settle in the present moment. An unsettled mind\\neither is worrying about the future or traveling into the past and rejecting, judging about an event\\nthat happened into your past. A simile used here is the monkey mind, constantly jumping\\nfrom one branch to another, unable to stay for too long time\\nat the present moment. The problem is there is no time\\nto see clearly anymore. Now, the last of the five hindrances\\nis called \"skeptical doubt,\" and it\\'s very closely related\\nto a state of mind which is based on indecisiveness. It is very easy in that state of mind\\ngetting lost in thoughts. Can I do this? Is this the right path? What will the others say? What if this? What if that? The mind cannot synchronize\\nwith your own actions anymore. And the result is that you are getting disconnected with the goals and aspirations \\nthat once you have set to yourself. When the way is filled\\nwith too much doubts, more often you will stop\\ninstead of moving on. That we know the five hindrances now, what are we going to do about them? You need to align and structure\\nyour life in such a way to prevent those hindrances from arising. If you are not successful, you need to use techniques\\nin order to remove them. Each of these hindrances is placing\\nthe dark cloud on your mind, or on the way of your climb. Simply remember one thing: Just let it rain. (Sound of rain) This is a four step method to help you removing those hindrances. The first step is recognize in what state of the mind\\nyou are finding yourself in. [Recognize, Accept,\\nInvestigate, Non-Identity] Afterwards, learn to accept, acknowledge, and allow the situation or a person to be the way how it is, to be the way how they are. Investigate your\\nemotional and mental state, and ask questions: Why did it come up? What is going to be the consequence\\nif I remain in that state? And ultimately, non-identification means: It is the practice. I am not the body. I am not the mind. I am not my emotion. It\\'s just that I can see\\nall these three aspects about me. All of our lifetimes, all of our lives are too unique to copy the path from someone else. To bring meaning to your life, to bring value into your life, you need to learn and master yourself, and don\\'t let the hindrances stop you. If any of you chooses to climb that path to clarity, I would be very happy\\nto meet you at the peak. (Music) (Applause)', 'Translator: Hang Do\\nReviewer: Queenie Lee Hello, everybody. I\\'m going to start with a question. How many of you know the person\\nsitting next to you from before today? Interesting. So, do you remember the first conversation\\nthat you ever had with that person? You know conversations are links. Let\\'s imagine every conversation\\nto be a tiny metal link. And every time you talk to a stranger, a metal link is formed. And every conversation that you have\\nafter that moment, the link gets stronger and stronger. And every day each one of us\\nmeets so many strangers: the grocery guy, the cab guy maybe the receptionist\\nat a new office you went to. And with every conversation\\nwe build new links. Until finally at the end, we\\'ve created a kind of massive\\nWorld Wide Web of conversation. World Wide Web. It\\'s a catchy word.\\nI think I\\'ve heard that somewhere. That\\'s it, right? A conversation.\\nIt\\'s a fascinating thing. A conversation is an adventure. A conversation gives you\\na whole new perspective. A conversation opens a door. Conversations can make war\\nand conversations can make peace. And conversations define\\nwho we are as a human race. Think about this. Every single person in your life\\nwas once a stranger to you. And you knew nothing about them\\nuntil you had that first conversation. So I\\'m here today to tell you\\nto talk to strangers, to have a conversation. And I\\'m here to tell you how. Seven ways that you can make\\na conversation with almost anyone. I\\'m a radio presenter and I love talking to people. I do. I love it. And I\\'m so glad that I do it for a living. Here\\'s what my day is like. Every single morning,\\nI go into an empty room, I put on a mic, and I have a conversation\\nwith 1.6 million people ... that I can\\'t see. Yeah. You know what the hardest part is, though? It\\'s time. In a four-hour show, I get 20 minutes. That\\'s all the talk there is. And in 20 minutes I have to convince you\\nthat I am your best friend. How do I do that? How do I establish a connection? I have 20 minutes to inform you,\\nto excite you, to engage with you but most importantly, 20 out of the 20 times\\nthat I switch on that mic, I have to leave a smile on your face. Except, I can\\'t see you,\\nI know nothing about you, and I have no way\\nof gauging your reactions. How do you do it?\\nHow do you talk to a stranger? Well, my nine years in radio\\nhave taught me these simple little tricks. Strangers, they are everywhere. And we\\'ve always been told,\\n\"Don\\'t talk to strangers!\" But I beg to differ. Every stranger comes with an opportunity, an opportunity to learn something new, an opportunity to have an experience\\nyou\\'ve never had or hear a story that you\\'ve\\nnever heard before. And you\\'ve had that moment, right? You\\'re in the room\\nwith someone you don\\'t know, and you look across the room,\\nyou see a stranger, and you think, \"I want to talk to this person.\" And you can almost hear the first word\\nbut it just won\\'t come out, it kind of gets stuck about here, it kind of goes up and down and you don\\'t know - You know what? Here\\'s my advice: just say it. What\\'s the worst that can happen? They want to talk to you.\\nWell, they\\'re not talking to you now. The first word floodgates. I truly believe that the first word\\nacts as a floodgate. You know, once you said the first word\\neverything else just flows. So keep it simple. A \"Hi,\" a \"Hey,\" a \"Hello.\" And do what every good bowler does. Just gather the enthusiasm,\\nthe positivity, the energy, put on a big smile and say, \"Hi!\" I know. There\\'s going\\nto be that strange moment right now. Turn to someone sitting next to you,\\nstick your hand out and say hello. Go on. (Laughter) I love the awkward laughter. \"Why is she making us do this?\" The first word floodgates. You know, here\\'s a challenge\\nwe face every day. Time. We have 90 seconds on radio, and we have to make that conversation\\nwith a stranger memorable. So how do you do it? What\\'s the biggest challenge? Honestly, if we get stuck in the rut of: \"Hi!\" \"Hey!\" \"How are you?\" \"I\\'m fine.\" \"What\\'s going on?\" \"Nothing much.\" \"Same old.\" \"So tell me what\\'s new?\" There you go, 45 seconds down, wasted. Right? So, here\\'s my advice: skip the small talk\\nand ask a really personal question. And don\\'t be afraid. Trust me. You will be surprised how much people\\nare willing to share if you just ask. So ask any kind of personal question. Maybe: Interesting name. How did your parents think of it?\\nIs there a story behind it? Or ... How long have you lived in this city? And do you remember\\nthe first day you landed here? Answers to those questions\\nare always something unique, always something personal. My favorite one to try is: Where do you come from?\\nAnd where does your family live? Unfailingly, every single time\\nI sit in a cab, I do this. I ask that question. Where do you come from?\\nAnd where does your family live? Let me tell you a little story. I was coming home one night ... I get into this taxi, open the door,\\nsit down and I say, \"Where are you from?\\nWhere does your family live?\" And the 60-year-old Pakistani\\ncab-driver goes on to tell me all about his life in Peshawar. We talked about politics, we talked about music,\\nfamily, wife, his farm. And 20 minutes later he is convinced\\nthat I am the perfect bride for his 26-year-old\\ncollege-educated son from Peshawar. (Laughter) And as I\\'m getting out of the taxi, he is taking out a passport-sized\\nphotograph with this look of enthusiasm. I have to say, it was a very\\ndifficult goodbye. But the moral of the story, really, is what starts with a \"Hello\"\\ncan end with a marriage proposal. And that is a warning. (Laughter) Step three. Find the \"me too\"s. Have you ever met someone who starts a conversation\\nlike they\\'re starting a debate? \"I am from Delhi.\"\\n\"I hate Delhi.\" (Laughter) Yeah? Nothing kills\\na conversation like a negative. When you meet someone for the first time make an effort to find the one thing that you and that other person\\nmight have in common. When you start at that point\\nand then move outward from there, you will find that all of a sudden\\nthe conversation becomes a lot easier. And that\\'s because both of you suddenly\\nare on the same side of something. And that\\'s a really powerful feeling. Now, what could you possibly have\\nin common with a stranger you ask? Could be anything, right? You\\'re both in the same place\\nat the same time, maybe you\\'re from the same country, maybe you both like the winter or you\\'re longing for it to rain. I don\\'t know, you\\'d find something. When you find a \"me too,\" you automatically have a kind of\\nbuy-in from the other person. Trust me, that\\'s helpful. Pay a unique compliment. I read somewhere\\nthat people will forget what you do, and they\\'ll forget what you say, but they will never forget\\nhow you made them feel. So be generous. And go out and give someone\\na nice full compliment. So, I have this belief\\nabout a \"compliment immunity meter\", and it comes from this experience I had when I met this gorgeous supermodel. And I look at her and I say, \"Wow! You are beautiful!\" And there is no reaction on her face. And I think to myself, \"How?\" That\\'s when I realized, she is immune to the word \"beautiful.\" She\\'s probably heard it\\na hundred thousand times today. And if she\\'s on social media, she\\'s heard it a million times today. There are some words that each of us\\nhave developed an immunity to. It could be \"nice,\" it could be \"awesome,\"\\nit could be \"cool\" ... Stay away from these. Try and construct a compliment\\nthat\\'s unique and genuine, and you don\\'t have to lie. Really. When you look at someone and say, \"I love how when you smile, it\\'s like your nose smiles,\\nand then your eyes smile, and your ears smile,\\neven your forehead smiles and suddenly, the whole person\\nis just smiling.\" You see, I hope that\\'s a compliment\\nyou\\'re not going to forget for a while. Pay a unique and genuine compliment. Ask for an opinion. All of us have opinions; trust me. And we all want them to be heard and everybody wants validation. So go on and ask for an opinion, and that\\'s when you\\nopen up a two-way street. That is when the real communication begins, and you will be surprised\\nhow much you can pick up about a person just by asking their opinion\\non something pretty generic. Here\\'s a mistake that some people make. They ask your opinion\\nabout something really difficult. It feels almost intimidating. Somewhere in a room,\\nfull of very well-informed people, and someone was to come up to me and say, \"So what do you think about the way the oil prices have affected\\nthe real estate market in Dubai?\" I feel a bit cornered. I feel like I might fail,\\nand this is an examination, and that\\'s the lesson. Nobody needs to fail\\nat a first-time conversation. Just ask something simple.\\nKeep it generic. How do you like your coffee? When did you watch your last movie?\\nWhat did you think of it? And when somebody gives you their opinion: really listen. Don\\'t listen to reply. Listen to listen. There\\'s a difference. And that brings me to my next point. Be present. I know you\\'ve been through this. I know I have. You\\'re pouring your heart out to someone, and they are like this, \"Yeah, yeah, go on, keep talking. I can multitask! What\\'s with Wi-Fi?\" (Laughter) You know, when someone\\'s trying\\nto communicate with you, the least you can do\\nis really be in that conversation. Just be wholeheartedly present, just be there. And - oh! - my favorite part:\\nmake eye contact. Trust me, eye contact\\nis where all the magic happens. You can feel the conversation. And trust me, when you\\nare looking at someone in the eye, nine out of ten times,\\nthey will not dare look away, right? (Laughter) Now, if only I could look\\ninto the eyes of 1.6 million people, I would not have to worry about you guys\\ntuning out during the ad breaks. That brings me to this, my favorite point\\nbecause I think it\\'s got a catchy name. Name, place, animal, thing. You remember that game? Remember the little details\\nabout a person. Remember their name.\\nIt\\'s so important. It\\'s awful when you meet someone\\nfor 18th time, and you say, \"You must be Paul, no Peter.\\nSomething with the P and it ends with ...\" It\\'s terrible. Remember someone\\'s name\\nand say it back to them. You have no idea how important\\nyou\\'re making them feel, and that\\'s not the only detail. Remember all the other details as well. The places they like to go to,\\nthe places they\\'ve been to, the places they want to go to,\\ntheir pet\\'s names. How their pet\\'s been feeling lately?\\nThe things they like. Remember their children\\'s names,\\nthat\\'s such a winner. Remember their wife\\'s names,\\ntheir girlfriend\\'s names. Just don\\'t mix up the last two\\nbecause that could be disastrous. (Laughter) Remember these little things about people\\nand repeat it back to them, ask be genuinely interested, and automatically you kind of\\nbecome an investor in their well-being, so they\\'ll feel responsible to you\\nto keep that conversation going. There we go. Seven amazing ways that you can\\nmake conversation with anyone, and seven reasons\\nwhy you should use the break that\\'s going to come up to talk\\nto a stranger that you don\\'t know. I\\'m going to end with this analogy. A conversation is like reading a book. You can turn to any page you want. You can flip to your favorite chapter. You can read as long as you want,\\nand you can read what you want, and every person, trust me,\\nis a really good book. And it saddens me so much that entire human lives\\nare being boiled down to 140 characters and catchy headlines. Because that\\'s not what we are. We are not abridged versions. We are entire human stories. We deserve more from each other. So what are you going to do\\nin this big world we call the library? Are you going to walk around, look at the hard bound copies\\nand read the titles? Or are you going to actually\\nreach for a book, open a page and start reading a story? You decide. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Transcriber: Yechezkel Stelzer\\nReviewer: Jeong-Lan Kinser I stopped watching porn \\nfor two reasons basically. The first one was that porn brought so much anger and violence\\ninto my private fantasies. And these were anger and violence that\\nwere not there originally to begin with. And I did not want it for me anymore. This was not me and,\\nI decided to just put an end to it. Easier said than done...\\nI got it later, but... The second reason was \\nthat I became to realize... I came to realize that\\nonly by watching porn I take part in creating\\na demand for filmed prostitution because that\\'s what porn really is:\\nfilmed prostitution. \"Pornē\" stands for prostitute,\\n\"graphia\" stands for documentation. Prostitution was\\nnobody\\'s childhood dream, it is always a result\\nof trouble and distress. Now, I became aware of that gradually,\\nwhen I was volunteering with men and women in prostitution,\\nsome of them victims of human traffic, serving aid in brothels,\\nunder the bridge and street corners. But you don\\'t really need to do all that\\nin order to understand how this mechanism of porn\\nand prostitution works. Because porn is a genre - it\\'s not about \\nerotica or healthy sexual communication. It\\'s all about male domination of women, \\nsubordinance of women. Not only the sexual practice,\\nbut as a way of being, as a genderial hierarchy in this world. If we would ask porn, how does it define something as sexual? What qualifies, what defines\\nsomething as sexual? Porn would laugh in our face. What defines sexual?\\nWhatever men find arousing... Men find it arousing to choke a woman? To have a brutal sex without one\\ntouch, hug, kiss, tender caress? Well then it is sexual. It arouses men to see\\na woman or child cry? It is sexual. It arouses men to rape a woman,\\nwell, then it is sexual. In every mainstream \\nporn gallery on the web, we can find the rape category side by side\\nwith the humiliation category, abuse category, crime category and so on. And this is all as if this regular porn\\nis not already filled with these motives. Even in its mildest version,\\nthe mildest version of porn, what porn is showing us like,\\nI know, 80%, maybe 90% of the time is actually sex with no hands involved.\\nThis is not how we authentically desire... Sorry, I\\'ll repeat that, I see your look.\\nSex with no hands involved... okay. If you and I are not going\\nto give up watching porn the next thing you do watch\\njust you just notice that porn cameras have\\nno interest in capturing any normal sensual activities\\nsuch as petting, caressing, making out, touching,\\nhugging, kissing... No... What porn cameras are into\\nis the penetration. So normally the composition\\nwill be a man and a woman, hopefully just one, okay...\\nso, one man and one woman... His penis is inside her. It doesn\\'t matter where inside.\\nSomewhere inside. His penis is somewhere inside her, \\nokay? And in order not to block the camera for doing this extreme close up\\non the penetration, he\\'s standing with his hands\\nbehind his back most of the time. And the woman is in this...\\nuncomfortable position and she needs to handle\\nthe penis inside her without damaging the hair\\nor make up or look down on her because that\\'s money invested\\nand time invested in her. Without disturbing his aggressive movement\\nand mainly without blocking the cameras. So the result is that we got\\ntwo people having sex different shapes and acrobatics \\nor something... but they\\'re having sex when the only body parts\\nthat actually touch each other are the penis\\nand the part being penetrated. No hands involved. I talked, I don\\'t know, 250-300 times\\na year, soldiers, students, pupils... No one has ever come up to me and say \"Ran, you know that part\\nwith sex with no hands thing that was my authentic desire,\\nlike when I was 11 or 12 I never wanted to kiss \\nor touch anybody. I was not curious about that.\\nIt was all the penetration to begin with.\" No one has ever said that...\\n-- before porn. After porn... In my private fantasies\\nbefore watching porn, there was always a very strong narrative and the narrative was\\nof sensuality and mutuality. Which means that I always imagined\\nwhat I would say to her? What would she possibly answer? What options do I have to respond? In real life it never worked\\nlike I planned, but it was important in my mind\\nin term of arousal the build up, the location,\\nthe setting, where will it be? What are the circumstances of me and her\\nbeing all alone all of a sudden. How will this bodily inflaming between us\\nwill emerge step by step? It was super important\\n...before porn. After making a habit out of porn... it conquers your mind\\nand it invades your brain. And I lost my ability to imagine. Which mean I found myself...\\nand I won\\'t be too explicit, but trying to masturbate,\\njust closing my eyes trying to fantasize desperately\\nabout something human and not making it\\nbecause my head was bombarded with all of those images of women\\nbeing violated and subordinated and forced into pretending they\\nenjoyed diabolic sperm rituals. So, this is pretty much the result. We are all vulnerable to pornography.\\nIt\\'s not just young people... We should be very careful. Not only what we put into our bodies\\nin term of food and nutrition... But with the nutrition of our mind. Everything we watch invades us. I\\'ll give you a short example\\nfrom non-sexual areas. I came the other night,\\nI came back home and my beloved one was watching\\nsome cultural junk. She was watching a karaoke show audition,\\nthe one with chairs spinning. We don\\'t have a TV set back home, but only because it allows us\\nto falsely present ourselves as deep and profound people.\\n(laughter) I\\'ve never heard of that. Mastectomy who? Angelina?\\nNo, we don\\'t have a TV. We watch every cultural\\njunk possible, okay? Neither me, nor her, \\ncontemplate about existence. We download stuff.\\nAnd we download all cultural junk. I am watching this 20 minutes\\nkaraoke show. And it was so boring and tedious. Two minutes talking,\\nfour minutes blabbering. I lost patience after 20 minutes\\nand I went off to take a shower and the most interesting\\npart was in the shower. Because what I found out there \\nwas myself in most pathetic state ever... I\\'m going to share it with you. I want to feel that you\\naccept and love me, so I will share my most pathetic moment\\nand you have to accept it now. I don\\'t know until I got over myself\\nif it took me five, seven, ten minutes to realize that I am standing\\nunder the water in the shower pondering severely what would\\'ve been\\nmy song for the auditions? Deep and profound, mind you! I won\\'t be doing\\nthis Rihanna or Lady Gaga\\'s. I will be doing Mercedes Sosa\\'s\\nComo Un Pájaro Libre. I\\'ll be doing a cover for\\nBob Dylan\\'s Blind Willie McTell. Ain\\'t that deep and profound? I had to realize that I\\'m an idiot\\nbecause I have no talent for music. More than that, I never wanted to be neither a musician\\nnor a singer or songwriter. This was never a part of my\\ninner world of wishes, okay? But I\\'m a human being.\\nWhat can I do? I was watching that for 20 minutes\\nIt entered my brain for a while. So if we take this example\\nwe can try to estimate the impact of 20 minutes\\nof watching no matter what, how it invades our mind \\nand conquers our wantings and desires. Let\\'s just try to imagine or\\nI can share it with you orally what is the impact\\nof 20 minutes of watching porn once or twice a week,\\nnothing unmoderated. It\\'s overtaking. And porn is in our household,\\nwhether we want it or not and I believe that it does not agree\\nwith our well being. Because we have internet in the western world all over the place\\nalmost in every cellular phone now we\\'ve got 90% of 12 year-olds\\nwatching porn on a regular basis. And it has both an addictive effect\\nand a paralyzing effect. It\\'s addictive, because it develops\\nsomewhat of a dependency on porn. And paralyzing because,\\nmainly for young boys and men, porn is teaching us that \\nas a man you are solely valued in sex by having a large penis\\nand an eternal erection. According to porn,\\nbeing a valuable sexual partner does not relate with being\\nsensual, passionate, attentive, generous, well-coordinated.\\nNone of the above. It is all about large penis\\nand eternal sunshine, which we don\\'t possess. So boys become paralyzed. And if they don\\'t become\\nparalyzed by watching porn very often they turn into imitators\\nof what they saw, which then means\\nthey become aggressors. Aggressors, \\neven when emotion is involved. There is so much sexual abuse\\ngoing on nowadays within the confines of what\\nwe perceive from the outside as beautiful teenage love stories,\\nor healthy adult relationships. Because we don\\'t really\\ntalk about sex we just see it all over,\\nwe don\\'t really talk about it. So, what goes on in the confines\\nof a certain room but these are all sexual mutations\\nthat happen. If we talk about women,\\nit\\'s not only that, but young girls even get the message\\nnot only from hardcore porn but from a porn influenced\\nmain stream culture. Have you seen any Miley Cirus,\\nLady Gaga video clips or commercials? That\\'s porn with clothes on. So girls get this notion that\\nif you want to be worthy of love first and foremost you have\\nto be worthy of sexual desire. And now, the definition of sexual desire\\nalmost equals: be like a porn star. So I work in dozens and dozens\\nof high schools and junior highs. In every single one\\nof these schools I find girls that at a certain point agreed\\nto be documentedin an intimate situation because they wanted to please some guy\\nthat they had feelings for. And this guy misappropriated their trust.\\nAlways the same story. So he sells it on WhatsApp application\\nor on the web, on the internet. And normally nobody even\\naddresses him in terms of moral. But it is always girls that suffer\\nfrom shaming and mortification. They can change the school...\\nthey drop out normally. They can move to another city \\nand still be haunted on social networks. They develop clinical depressions,\\nsevere eating disorders, as if we don\\'t have enough reasons in \\nour culture to develop eating disorders. They become so isolated socially. So some of them - like Amanda Todd,\\nrest in peace... - some of them actually commit suicide. Because they find no more value\\nin life or in themselves. So, porn is not only in our house.\\nIt is a capital case. It is not a minor phenomenon\\nin our society. It is a question\\nof life and death sometimes. It is mainly a question of life and death\\nfor the people who participate in porn, because porn is not an embodiment\\nof freedom of speech, freedom of occupation, blah-blah... No.\\nIt\\'s an embodiment of sex-exploitation, working side-by-side with human traffic\\nraping, pimping, solicitation. For every one porn star\\nwith a book contract or a production company, we\\'ve got hundreds of\\nthousands of women and girls who do not survive out there.\\nLiterally, they just don\\'t make it. The sex industry just chews them up\\nand spits them back into brothels, into hooking in the street, escorting, massage parlors\\nwith happy or unhappy ending depends who you ask.\\nAnd I am not joking. This is the whole\\nspectrum of prostitution. So many of them do not even\\nmake it to the age of 50. I am talking about countries\\nthat the life expectancy is at 75, 76 years now. They don\\'t make it to the age of 50.\\n4 reasons mainly. Drugs, STD - Sexually\\nTransmitted Diseases being murdered by a john,\\na pimp, a boyfriend and the fourth reason\\nis suicide once again. Because if you are a prostitute,\\non camera or off camera, you are in the situation that\\nwe can refer to as social death. We have all sat on the dinner table with people who probably\\nconsumed prostitution that have been to a brothel\\nonce, twice at least. We never sit down\\nto the table with a prostitute. Not with a declared one.\\nSo that\\'s social death. It is not glamorous. Not at all. And when I sit in the privacy of my room\\nand watch porn, even without paying... No need to pay, it\\'s free. I hope you know that,\\nif you\\'re still consuming... Whatever I am watching\\nis creating a demand. And wherever there is a demand,\\nthere will be a supply. There is a correlation. If I watch pornography of black, \\nolder women, somebody is going to go out\\nand pimp black older women. Asian minors? Somebody is\\nalready trafficking Asian minors in order to film them. Israeli women, Palestinian women\\nWASP, all American college girls. It\\'s a strong in the last few years\\nit\\'s a very upcoming category. The scum of the Earth\\nare already out there trying to solicit and prostitute\\nthese women on camera. So, I stopped watching porn\\nfor my personal well-being. My intimate communication,\\nmy private erotic life. Reclaiming control\\nand responsibility over my mind. But by doing that, I actually stopped contributing\\nto this horrible sex industry. That\\'s a good thing to do,\\nI believe. And I would really like\\nto propose that notion of physically and emotionally-safe sex,\\nemotionally-safe sex. It does not mean going back to be\\nconservative or unliberated sexually. I am all for sexual freedom. It just means that we need to put\\ngenderial hierarchy aside, subordinance aside. And bring back in...\\nlet\\'s just say, \"laughter\" as a critical method for intimacy. Two souls, two humans,\\ntwo souls alone in private, can they please have a laugh together? Whether they know each other\\nfor a decade or for an hour... If two souls alone in a room \\ndo not manage to have a laugh together, what good could possibly grow there?\\nSexual and non-sexual. That\\'s emotionally safe sex. I\\'ve got so many things\\nI want to share with you but I feel like my time\\nis almost up, so... I just really want to ask for us\\nto speak about these issues more because I strongly feel that our history\\nof silence never did us any good, because silence\\nonly perpetuates more silence, when talking normally\\ngives birth to more talking, more sharing, more identification,\\nmore awareness, more change. A small change,\\nwe have a small humble life. But a real change, a true one,\\nemotionally safer. Thank you for listening.', 'Reviewer: Zsuzsa Viola Namaste! Today, as you see me\\nas a package of success, when my bio says that I have cleared\\nall the top prestigious exams and interviews of India. My friends, let me tell you\\nnot more about my successes but more about my rejections, my failures,\\nand my determination, my willpower that made me get those successes. So my story starts from a small\\nsleepy village of Madhya Pradesh with a population\\nof barely a thousand people. On the month of a rainy August, a small girl was born\\nin an orthodox Brahmin family - a family that was giant\\nand joint with 30 plus members - it was not an event for them. There was nothing that worth celebrating\\nhappened that day when I was born, only two souls on Earth were happy, obviously, they were my parents, for the rest of them,\\nit was a normal affair. 25 years down the line,\\nsame girl, same village, and the whole family\\nwas welcoming her with garlands, bang bang slogans like, (Hindi) \"What should a girl look like?\\nLike Surabhi Gautam! Why not?\" What made things\\nto become so different for her? (Applause) My dear friends, let me tell you\\nhow things changed not only for me but also for my parents, how all the perspectives got changed\\nslowly, slowly, steadily, steadily. I was in a joint family. In a joint family, you know,\\nno child gets separate attention. So we all were treated equally. Life was OK. We were happy. I got admission in my village school. That was Hindi medium: Madhya Pradesh Board School. In 5th class, something good happened with me\\nthat I remember till date. I got 100 out of 100\\nin my mathematics paper. 5th class was a board class. So my teacher called me, and she said, \"See, I have never seen anybody\\nscoring full marks, that in mathematics, that in board exam. You have done this, so I think you are going to do\\nsomething good in your studies.\" That was the day when I felt appreciated and recognized, and I had given this\\nclear message to the Universe that in future, all I\\'m going to do\\nis to be a studious girl because with studies comes recognition, with studies will come\\nappreciation for me. Otherwise, in this family,\\nI\\'m not going to get this at all. So I started to focus more on studies. But my heart - it always\\nwanted to diversify. I wanted to do everything. I started to try my hand\\nat painting, sketching, drawing. I started to do embroidery also. I was busy with my village priest, and all the pujas, and on all the Ramayan\\n(Hindi) events (English) and everything. And I was not noticing the pain\\nthat was creeping in my body. I started to feel the pain\\nin my joints and my elbow and every joint of my body, and after some time, I was bedridden. My parents took this decision\\nwith their meager resources to take me there. We went there to a place called Jabalpur. And the doctor said, \"Your daughter\\nhas this rheumatic fever.\" What happens in this disease is - there are viruses\\nalways present in the air. Now and then, they attack\\nthe body of children, and they create pain. And when it becomes serious,\\nwhat happens, they attack your heart and they disturb the semilunar valve. And in some cases, it leads to death also. It was a shock for them. But then they asked,\\n\"What can be the possible treatment?\" As a treatment, the doctor suggested that she should be given\\nthe dose of antibiotic, and that antibiotic was penicillin. There is some problem\\nwith penicillin. What happens? As soon as it enters the body,\\nit gets solidified when it comes in contact with air. So it was again a problem because I had to be injected\\nwith penicillin in every 15 days. And not every MBBS doctor\\nwas ready to do this because it can also\\nlead to death in some cases. So in the village, in every 15 days, it was also difficult\\nto get a skilled doctor to inject me with the confidence\\nthat I will not die. Well, life was going OK, OK. There was a problem\\nof electricity in my village. So I had to study by the kerosene lamp. I had other problems. There was no tuition. School situation was also very bad. Then the second best thing\\nof my life happened. It was the 10th class result. My 10th results came, and I again scored 100 out of 100 - this time not only in mathematics\\nbut also in science. (Applause) And my percentage was good enough\\nto place me on the state merit list. Well, I became a pseudo-celebrity of my village. I was in the news for quite a week,\\nand the newspaper interviewer came to me, and he started to ask me questions, \"How did you do this?\" you know? \"This is a great achievement and all.\" And at last, he asked one question, \"Surabhi, what do you want\\nto become when you grow up? You know, what is your career choice?\" Well, I was not knowing what a career is. All I was knowing that, \"OK, I\\'m good at dancing,\\nso I can be a dancer. I can be a singer, too. I can paint also. But a career?\" I told him, \"Sir,\\nI cannot recall anything. I cannot answer this question to you.\" He said, \"Come on,\\nyou have to answer this. You have got a place in the merit list.\" Suddenly, a word flashed\\nin my mind out of nowhere, and I said, \"I want to be a collector.\" Well, he got the headline\\nfor the next day, and I was damned. Next day, the news came. (Hindi) \"Surabhi\\nwants to become a collector.\" (Applause) This news changed, you know, the course of everything\\nfor me after that. Everyone was coming to my home\\nwith the sweets, to my parents, and they were saying that, (Hindi) \"Mr. Gautam, your girl\\nwill achieve something great.\" I was enjoying all that limelight, but I was not knowing\\nhow to be a collector, what a collector is,\\nand how important he is for society. I went into 11th; I took mathematics, and I forgot about all these things. Yeah, I wanted to correct something\\nthat was wrong in my village, that was wrong with my education, that was wrong\\nwith the situation of my village, that there was no electricity,\\nthere was no proper hospital. So I wanted those things\\nto be on right place, but through collector or not through it, I was not clear. Well, I passed 12th, and I got APJ Abdul Kalam Scholarship for securing maximum marks\\nin science stream. So again, one more\\npseudo-celebrity status. And with all this status,\\nI came to this big city of Bhopal, in this very college and took admission\\nfor Bachelor of Engineering. (Applause) This decision of my parents to send me from the village to a big city\\nfor higher education was a big decision because I was the first girl\\nfrom my village to go out and study. So it was not only I\\nwho was studying here; it was the whole village along with me. If I [didn\\'t] come back, the hopes of all other girls,\\nthe door for all other girls will close automatically. So I had to perform here anyhow. Well, the first day of my college\\nwas the worst day of my college, to be frank, because what happened, when I entered the college, there was chemistry lab that was going on. I entered the class,\\nand the ma\\'am was taking the lab. She asked me, \"OK,\\nyou go and do titration.\" Titration. In my village, there was no lab. I do not know the meaning\\nof titration in Hindi. So I was standing there blank. Again, I looked at ma\\'am. She asked me, \"Go there\\nand pick up the test tube.\" First time in my life\\nI\\'d seen the test tube, and I took that, and it broke. And I was like, \"Oh my God,\\nwhat I have done!\" Anyhow, I was hiding behind something\\nso that ma\\'am should not notice me. And I passed one hour. Then the next class: engineering physics. Introductions were going on,\\nand everyone was standing and fluently answering,\\ngiving their introduction in English, and I was freezing in my seat, that when my turn will come,\\nwhat am I supposed to do? What will I say? I do not know English at all. I\\'m from a Hindi medium school;\\nhow will I introduce myself? I was stealing words\\nfrom everyone\\'s introduction, and anyhow I jotted down the words\\nand gave my introduction. And I thought, \"OK, this has passed.\" But the sir was not patient enough. He asked me one more question. He asked me: \"OK. Tell me\\nthe definition of potential.\" OK, the basic question of physics. I have got APJ Abdul Kalam scholarship\\nfor scoring maximum marks in physics, PCM. But I had to answer this in English. And I cannot frame a sentence - a single sentence in English. So I just stood there and I kept mum. Teacher came to me and he said, \"Have you really completed your 12th? Have you really passed it? You cannot answer this very basic\\nquestion of physics.\" Only I knew how much I loved physics. I\\'m not answering this\\nnot because I do not know physics, it is because I do not know English. But this all was going on in my mind only. I was not able to speak anything. Well, I came back to my room,\\nand I wept, you know, I cried. I just wanted to pack my bag\\nand go back to my village, no more higher education, nothing else. This city is not meant for me. This college is not meant for me. These people are not meant for me. I called my parents. That day they played\\nthe role of Jambavan - the role that Jambavan\\nplayed for Hanuman, reminding him all of his great past that \"No, you can fight. No, you can fly.\" They told me that,\\n\"OK, you come back, but see, you are closing the door\\nof all other girls of your village. So you had to take up a decision.\" Well, I picked the point, and I decided to fight, and I decided that by the end\\nof this semester I\\'m going to be fluent in English. Well, I took my engineering books, I jotted down all the spellings\\nand everything, I pasted them on my wall, and all my walls were colored\\nwith the spellings, and I was always on the revision mode. And it went deep inside\\nmy subconscious mind that, you know, that my dreams\\nalso were in English after that, with all the characters speech ... (Applause) And in the first semester, I topped - I topped not only my college, but I topped the whole university, and I got Chancellor\\'s\\nscholarship for that. That day - that day I had this belief that if you really want\\nto achieve something anyhow, you know, you do not have any means, because when I wanted\\nto improve my English, I was not able to take coaching, and I was not having\\nany English medium friend, so I was totally unarmed. But I do not know\\nhow the universe conspired, and I finally was able to give\\na TED Talk even on this platform. Well, the college passed, and I completed my college\\nwhen I was twenty and a half, so you need 21 years\\nas the minimum age for UPSC exam. So meanwhile, I wrote GATE exam,\\nISRO exam, BARC exam, SAIL exam, and PPSC exam, and after six months, I wrote IES exam. And my dear friends,\\nI qualified all of them. (Applause) Then the first call letter that I got, that was from Bhabha Atomic\\nResearch Centre, Department of Atomic Energy, Mumbai. So I was very excited. OK, I\\'m going to give this highly - you know, touted as one of the most,\\nthe first interview of India. So I was about to appear\\nin that interview. I consulted some of my seniors\\nabout how it can be, how should I prepare for it? All I got was negative feedback: See, Surabhi, in whole of our life, we have never seen anybody\\nqualifying that interview. OK, you want to go\\nto Mumbai for fun, then go, but don\\'t have this expectation\\nthat you\\'re going to do anything there. Well, this - all this negativity,\\nI appeared in interview, and I was the first scientist to whom I was known\\nas a scientist in my life. So, I qualified that interview\\nand I shifted to Mumbai, and I became a nuclear scientist. Well, I wrote IES exam meanwhile, and it takes one year\\nfor the results to come. After one year, the result came. And I was AIR 1, not from any IIT,\\nnot from any NIT, I was from UIT, and I topped the exam. (Applause) (Cheering) I was the first lady in India\\nto top Engineering Services Exam, and my marks were maximum\\nin the history of UPSC till date. (Applause) So finally, after becoming\\na Sarkari officer, I resigned from BARC, and I joined Indian Railways\\nthrough Engineering Service, and I went to Secunderabad\\nfor Railways training. I was getting a salary; there is no financial problem. You know, I was getting\\nrespect from society. So I didn\\'t want to study anymore, no hard work, so all party was waiting for me. And I was very excited, \"OK, life is now going\\nto be a smooth ride, no more hard work,\\nno more sacrifices and all; I have done enough.\" Well, I joined Railways,\\nand I was thinking to enjoy. I was trying hard to enjoy and be happy. But I was not happy. And I was not knowing what is wrong\\nwith all these things. So I called my mother, and I asked her, \"Why is it happening with me?\\nWhy I am not enjoying all this?\" She said, \"Do you remember\\nyour 10th class interview? Have you ever read\\nthat piece of paper again that you said you want to be something\\nor you want to do something for your village and all those things? Was this struggle was only\\nfor a Sarkari job or a good salary, or was this for something else also?\" Well, I really recalled,\\nand I read this interview again. And I don\\'t know how many times\\nin my life I\\'ve read it. And I decided to prepare\\nfor civil service examination. Well, this examination, I want to say, is one of the toughest exams,\\nin not only India but in the world. Eleven like aspirants appear for this, and mostly it takes four, five\\nattempts for them to clear. Students in Delhi,\\nif you will go there and see, they are giving their 24 hours every day and preparing for this exam. And I was doing the job of Railways,\\nwas deciding to prepare for this exam. I was hardly getting three or four hours\\nfrom my training to prepare for this exam. I could not take leave in training also. So the decision was going to be\\na very tough decision for me, but with all those things,\\nI decided to go ahead, and I started my preparation. I was mostly on train roaming\\nfor Railway training, so I got a tab, and I downloaded all the things, so I started reading online. I read on mobile, I read in my tab, and I was mostly on,\\nyou know, stealing mode. I was stealing minutes from hours. And sometimes I felt frustrated;\\nI felt like giving up. Again, I called my mom. She was a continuous mentor for me. So I called her, I said, \"See, even after becoming\\na Sarkari officer, I have to do again all these things,\\nlife is so miserable for me. I was never enjoying when I was a child, and today, also when I\\'m an officer, I\\'m not enjoying. I\\'m only doing studies, and I don\\'t know\\nwhere it is going to lead. Am I going to qualify it or not? I\\'m not sure, but still\\nI am again studying, studying all the time. She said me one thing, \"See, you are 23. When I was 23,\\nI had three children. The youngest of them was 10 months old. I had a family of 30-plus members\\nto whom I had to cook meal. Then I had a job 10 kilometers away\\nfrom our village to another village, so I had to go and do that also, and then I had allergic skin,\\nso for that, I had to visit doctor, and I have to cover my body all the time. So I had all these problems,\\nbut I never complained. You, on the other hand, do not have any social responsibility,\\nfamily responsibility, all you have is your dream. All you want is to prove for yourself because for others,\\nyou have already proved. This is your task. You have to do. And you are saying\\nlife is difficult for you. You need to change your lenses better.\" That day I stopped complaining\\nmostly, at least with her, and I was totally on a mission mode. All my scarcities,\\nI converted them into my luxuries. The more I struggled,\\nthe more strong I became. And finally, I got All India Rank 50\\nin this coveted exam - Civil Services Examination 2016. (Applause) To summarize: At last, I believed in these words. These words truly tell my story. And I also want to convey\\nthese words to you also, \"There is no substitute for hard work,\\nand there is no shortcut to success.\" And my own four lines that I wrote - I want to say (Hindi), \"Had I mourned for what I had not got -\\nHad I mourned for what I had not got I wouldn\\'t have been able\\nto improve in the opportunities I got. It is stubbornness to fight\\nwith fate and achieve something. These things would not\\nhave arisen in me like this. But it was my promise\\nto myself to keep on moving I also mourned about getting nothing. But it was my promise\\nto myself to keep on moving. Whatever my steps measured is less. Whatever my steps measured is less. This is the secret\\nto reach your destination. This is the secret\\nto reach your destination.\" (Applause) Thanks for being such a patient\\nand such a good audience. Thanks TED and thanks to everyone. (Applause) (Cheering)', 'Transcriber: Jessika Malo\\nReviewer: Peter van de Ven If we begin with a construct\\nthat we are a collection of stories. We are the stories that we tell,\\nthe stories that we believe, and, equally, the stories\\nthat we choose to ignore. And so, I am going to revisit some of these old,\\nforgotten, lost stories, today. Let\\'s start at the beginning;\\nlet\\'s start with the story of creation. You know creation is not a simple process,\\nand let no one ever tell you otherwise. According to Hindu belief,\\nit is not even a one-man job. You need three people for it. You need one to create,\\none to preserve and one to destroy. But Brahma - Brahma is the great father,\\nthe creator - when Brahma created\\nthe world from his mind, he decided in his arrogance that he was also going to be\\nthe master of life and death. And for this world\\nthat he was going to create, he was going to populate it with beings\\nthat were both man and woman in one body; beings that would self-fertilize. So the plan was, he was going to get these beings\\nto create a child from within themselves without any outside help, feed and look after this child\\nfor six years, at which point the child\\nwould become self-sufficient, and the parent being\\nwould automatically die off. So, in Brahma\\'s world,\\nthere was going to be no mess, no overcrowding. But when he actually created\\nthese beings from his mind, he discovered that they were all men. The creator hadn\\'t quite worked out\\nhow to manifest a woman. Shiva came to the rescue, Shiva is one of the trinity,\\nhe is the destroyer, and Shiva is married to mother Earth. Shiva came in and he reached\\ninto Brahma\\'s mind, and he pulled out a woman:\\nBrahma\\'s mind-born daughter. And then he explained to Brahma\\nabout men and about women and about the ecstasy of coming together. Unfortunately, Brahma was not listening because he had taken one look\\nat his beautiful mind-born daughter, and decided he wanted her. And Shiva had had to sit there and watch the great father\\nlusting after his own daughter, chasing his daughter all over the cosmos\\nbecause he wanted to possess her. He realized what kind of sin\\nhe had brought into the world. And so, to try to mitigate this sin,\\nShiva castrated himself. He merged with his own wife,\\nand he went back to Brahma, and he said, \"Look, plan A. This is how you create a being \\nthat\\'s both man and woman in one body. Let\\'s go back to this plan.\" But by now, Brahma had known\\nthe ecstasy of coming together. And so, he prised apart Shiva\\nfrom his wife, and he said, \"From now on, men and women\\nwill be born as separate entities, they will live as separate entities,\\nand they will know the joy of union.\" And then Brahma created\\na race of men and a race of women, he paired them up together and said,\\n\"Go and populate my world.\" Unfortunately, nothing happened\\nbecause no one knew what to do. And so, Shiva once again,\\ncame to the rescue. He said to the men and women, he said, \"Go and tickle each other,\\nand the rest will follow.\" (Laughter) They did and 7 billion people later,\\nthe rest is history. At this point, Shiva and his wife -\\nParvati, mother Earth - went on to write a manual each -\\nthe first of its kind - a manual each, on the arts of seduction. Now, I should interrupt\\nmyself here and just say I don\\'t like the word \"seduction.\" It\\'s kind of taken on\\nall manner of implications that don\\'t really belong to it, but I haven\\'t been able\\nto find the mot juste, you know, at least in English. So, I am going to use the word, but I am going to try\\nand explain the concept to you. According to Tantra,\\naccording to high philosophy, sexual energy is the highest form\\nof energy in the world, and to be able to harness it\\nis to generate the ultimate power. And so the arts of seduction\\nwas about building up, optimizing and harnessing the power\\nof the mind, the body and the spirit, in order to generate the ultimate power. Ok, so this is a very large subject, and I am going to give you\\nabout a half a drop worth, but in the Kamasutra it says that men and women need to learn 64 skills to become adept at the arts of seduction. Some things make sense, ok, you know: singing, dancing,\\nperfuming of the body, gymnastics; some things really don\\'t. I mean, what does a skill in mineralogy\\nhave to do with the arts of seduction? Or a skill in quail fighting? (Laughter) Cock fighting? Ram fighting? I love this one the best: what does a skill in making\\nhandicrafts out of thread have to do with the arts of seduction? It\\'s listed in the 64 arts. Ok, 64 was not the number of ways\\nthat you could seduce somebody. 64 was the totality of your life. If you take your life\\nand you divide it into four stages, each stage then gets divided\\ninto four branches of knowledge that you must acquire during each stage. That gives you 16 branches of knowledge. And then you divide\\neach branch of knowledge further into four,\\nto cover all its aspects, and you get the number 64. So, a complete knowledge\\nof the arts of seduction was equated with complete mastery\\nof your entire life. Yeah, about optimizing and harnessing the power of the mind,\\nthe body and the spirit. And, I\\'ll let you in to a quick secret:\\naccording to ancient wisdom, this complete knowledge\\nof the arts of seduction and the ability to practice it, this was known as the elixir of youth. You know, when Cleopatra\\ndecided to seduce Julius Caesar, she didn\\'t just want him for one night,\\nshe wanted him for keeps, and she wanted him to the exclusion\\nof every other woman. This is Caesar, the emperor\\nof the largest known empire of the time. He\\'s rich, he\\'s spoiled, he can have anybody he wants,\\nhe can do anything he wants, and she wants him all to herself forever. Do you know what was the tool\\nof seduction that she chose to use? Aside from the obvious. She decided that he was going to - well, she was going to be completely happy for every single minute\\nthat he spent with her. So he would associate her with just\\nhis happiest moments in his life. She decided that he was\\ngoing to laugh with her more than he had ever laughed\\nwith any other woman. And we know from history that it worked. This brings me to the other story,\\nwhich I find is going out, literally, and that is that, you know, the skills of the arts of seduction\\nwere not just meant as a skill for women. It was equally important for the men. And that is a story\\nthat\\'s becoming completely obsolete. Because, every time I do this talk, and I say, \"Well, for a woman\\nto be truly seductive, she had to be intelligent, amusing,\\nbeautiful, fragrant, sexy, subtle, discreet, porcelain-skinned,\\ngood at singing, good at dancing, good at playing musical instruments,\\nwell-spoken, well-behaved, well-read, nails painted, toes polished,\\nlips reddened, legs waxed... And what did a man have to be? And every time, the answer is: rich.\\nHe just has to be rich. If he\\'s rich, he doesn\\'t\\nhave to do anything else. Not so. And then you hear those hideous websites, which tell a woman: be completely perfect. And if the man is doing\\nsomething you don\\'t like: don\\'t complain, smile and pretend. Or if he is boring you to tears: don\\'t complain, smile and pretend. No, no, no. If we say that the arts of seduction were about building up,\\noptimizing and harnessing the energy of the mind,\\nthe body and the soul to generate the ultimate power, it was equally important\\nfor a man to participate fully. Not just that the man\\nsupposed to participate fully and know all about\\nthe skills of seduction; he also had to be able\\nto understand the nuances, the expertise, the finesse\\nwith which he was being seduced, in order to maximize his sexual energies. Yes? You know, there were lots of books written about the role of the men. There\\'s a prelude to one of these books - I absolutely love the story\\nand I am going to share it with you. So, there was a king sitting in his court,\\nsurrounded by all his ministers, and this woman rushes into the court,\\nand she is stark naked, and there\\'s complete mayhem in the court. A woman. Naked.\\nIn broad daylight. In the presence of the King. Ahhhh! So, people rush forward\\nto try and clothe her, and she stops them and she says: \"No. I have decided\\nthat I will no longer, ever, wear a stitch of clothing\\ntill my wish is fulfilled.\" So, the king - you know, it\\'s a matter of pride,\\nhe can make things happen - he says, \"Go ahead,\\ntell me what is it that you want.\" And she says, \"Well,\\nI am completely fed up because in all my life,\\nthere\\'s never been a man who has taken the trouble\\nto try and satisfy me in bed. Not one. Not ever. And I have decided that till I\\'m satisfied completely,\\nI will not get dressed.\" (Laughter) Now, the King, he\\'s given his word,\\nhe looks at his ministers expectantly, the minsters look at the king expectantly, they have a little hurried discussion, and they discover to their complete dismay that there is not one man in that room\\nwho could say with any conviction that he\\'s going to be able\\nto satisfy a woman completely. Now, ladies and gentlemen, \\nimagine the level of panic. What if this form of rebellion took? What if all their wives\\ntook to the streets naked, demanding sexual satisfaction? Don\\'t worry, the story has a happy ending. The King put out a reward. A man came forward out of nowhere,\\nhe took this woman by the hand, he took her away, and the next morning\\nshe came back to the king\\'s court, completely dressed from head to foot. A picture of demureness. And she confirmed that she\\nhad been completely satisfied. The king immediately commissioned\\nthis man to write a book, putting down all his knowledge, so that it would be available\\nto every single person in his kingdom, and never would a woman\\nhave to walk the streets naked again. (Laughter) I absolutely love this story,\\nbut I have to say, I am in awe of the kind of width\\nof experience, the detail, the research that went into these books. Specifically, on the role of men. Do you know, there\\'s even an old book that talks about the shifting\\nof a woman\\'s erogenous zones according to the movement of the moon? The idea being that a woman\\'s sexuality is liquid, so it is affected\\nby the phases of the moon. And again, it is a huge subject, so I\\'m just going to give you\\na couple of examples, you know, broad strokes. So, they said that on the 14th day of the waxing\\nand the waning moon, for instance, the most sensitive part of a woman\\nis her head and her hair, and the best way\\nto get her sexual energy up is to massage the scalp gently, and the 13th day, it\\'s the eyes,\\nso the eye-lids should be kissed - apparently the right eye\\nis more sensitive during the waxing moon, and the left eyelid\\nduring the waning moon. On the 7th day - I am not going to give you all the details\\nbecause I don\\'t have that much time - but on the 7th day, it is the navel\\nthat is the most sensitive, and ideally it should be tapped\\nwith an open palm. On the 4th day, it is the knees,\\nhis knees should press against her knees. The 5th day is the lazy man\\'s day, a man doesn\\'t have to do very much\\non the 5th day. The woman is pretty much\\nself-sufficient on the fifth day - (Laughter) of both the waning and the waxing moon. And just for your\\nlittle bit of information, today is the 7th, no, today is\\nthe 6th day of the phase of the moon, and apparently today\\nis the bottom, the buttocks, which should be gently tapped (Laughter) gently tapped with a fist. And then of course, it goes further\\ninto the permutations and combinations. It is an incredible piece of work,\\nbut as I said, there is so much information,\\nand it gets lost because of the word seduction\\nhaving been a victim of evolution. So, I don\\'t have very much more time,\\nso I am going to actually finish with a little tiny example\\nof my favorite part, one of my favorite parts\\nof the arts of seduction, and that is about\\nthe perfuming of the body. Now, the perfuming of the body was supposed to be\\na subtly shifting phenomena, so you add a certain dye\\nto get a base scent, and you apply different perfumes\\nto the rest of your - every part of the body. The hair, had to be perfumed with khuss. Khuss - for those of you\\nwho are not of a South Asian background - is the smell of fresh rain\\nas it falls in scorching hot soil. It is the ultimate\\naphrodisiac in the world. So, hair with khuss,\\nneck with jasmine, arms with mint. There is a reason\\nfor every part of the body, ok. The belly button, with a very heavy musk,\\nto draw somebody in. The curve of the waist,\\nwith a very subtle extract of roses, so you have to press your face into it. And the back - this is my favorite - the back had to be dotted,\\nnot dropped over, dotted with little dabs of sandalwood, so you\\'ve created a trail,\\nfor someone to follow. Because at the end of it, you have to be like a banquette\\nof tastes, of textures, of smells. Ladies and gentlemen, in closing, can I just suggest that this is a story\\nthat you should try at home. (Laughter) (Applause)', 'Transcriber: Giancarlo Castelo Alí\\nReviewer: Sofia Ramundo Nina Dølvik Brochmann: Like most of you, we grew up believing\\nthat the hymen is a proof of virginity, but it turns out we were wrong. What we discovered is that the popular story\\nwe\\'re told about female virginity is based on two anatomical myths. The truth has been known \\nin medical communities for over a hundred years. Yet somehow, these two myths\\ncontinue to make life difficult for women around the world. Ellen Støkken Dahl:\\nThe first myth is about blood. It tells us that the hymen\\nbreaks and bleeds the first time a woman has vaginal sex. In other words, if there is no blood\\non the sheets afterwards, then the woman was simply not a virgin. The second myth \\nis a logical consequence of the first. Since the hymen is thought \\nto break and bleed, people also believe \\nthat it actually disappears or is in some way radically altered\\nduring a woman\\'s first intercourse. If that were true, one would easily be able to determine\\nif a woman is a virgin or not by examining her genitals,\\nby doing a virginity check. NDB: So that\\'s our two myths: virgins bleed and hymens are lost forever. Now, this may sound\\nlike a minor issue to you. Why should you care about an obscure\\nlittle skinfold on the female body? But the truth is this is about so much more\\nthan an anatomical misunderstanding. The myths about the hymen\\nhave lived on for centuries because they have cultural significance. They have been used as a powerful tool\\nin the effort to control women\\'s sexuality in about every culture, religion,\\nand historical decade. Women are still mistrusted,\\nshamed, harmed, and in the worst cases\\nsubjected to honor killings if they don\\'t bleed\\non their wedding night. Other women are forced\\nthrough degrading virginity checks, simply to obtain a job,\\nto save their reputation, or to get married. ESD: Like in Indonesia, where women are systematically examined\\nto enter military service. After the Egyptian uprisings in 2011, a group of female protesters\\nwere forced to undergo virginity checks by their military. In Oslo, doctors are examining\\nthe hymens of young girls to reassure parents\\nthat their children are not ruined. And sadly, the list goes on. Women are so afraid not to live up\\nto the myths about the hymen that they choose to use\\ndifferent virginity quick fixes to assure a bleeding. That could be plastic surgery\\nknown as revirgination; it could be vials of blood\\npoured on the sheets after sex; or fake hymens bought online,\\ncomplete with theater blood and a promise to kiss\\nyour deep dark secrets goodbye. NDB: By telling girls\\nthat no deed can be kept secret, that their bodies\\nwill reveal them, no matter what, we have endowed them with fear. Girls are afraid of ruining themselves, either through sports, play,\\ntampon use, or sexual activity. We have curtailed their opportunities\\nand their freedoms. It\\'s time we put an end\\nto the virginity fraud. It\\'s time we break the myths\\nabout the hymen, once and for all. ESD: We are medical students,\\nsexual health workers, and the authors\\nof \"The wonder Down Under.\" (Laughter) That\\'s a popular science book\\nabout the female genitals. And in our experience,\\npeople seem to believe that the hymen is some kind of a seal\\ncovering the vaginal opening. In Norwegian, it is even called\\nthe virgin membrane, and with this,\\nwe picture something fragile, something easily destructible,\\nsomething you can rip through, perhaps like a sheet of plastic wrapping. You may have wondered why\\nwe brought a hoola hoop on stage today. (Laughter) Now, it is very hard to hide that something has happened\\nto this hoop, right? It is different before\\nand after I punched it. The seal is broken, and unless we change the plastic\\nit won\\'t get back to its intact state. So if we wanted to do a virginity check\\non this hoop, right here, right now, that would be very easy. It\\'s easy to say that this hoop\\nis not a virgin anymore. NDB: But the hymen is nothing\\nlike a piece of plastic you can wrap around \\nyour food, or a seal. In fact, it\\'s more like this: a scrunchie or a rubber band. The hymen is a rim of tissue\\nat the outer opening of the vagina, and usually it has a doughnut\\nor a halfmoon shape with a large central hole, but this varies a lot,\\nand sometimes hymens can have fringes, it can have several holes,\\nor it can consist of lobes. In other words, hymens naturally\\nvary a lot in looks, and that is what makes it so hard\\nto do a virginity check. ESD: Now that we know a bit more\\nabout the hymen\\'s anatomy, it\\'s time to get back to our two myths: virgins bleed, hymens are lost forever. But the hymen doesn\\'t have\\nto break at all. The hymen is like a scrunchie,\\nin function as well as in looks. And you can stretch a scrunchie, right? (Laughter) You can stretch a hymen too; \\ninfact, it\\'s very elastic, and for a lot of women, the hymen will be elastic enough\\nto handle a vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage. For other women, the hymen may tear a bit\\nto make room for the penis, but that won\\'t make it disappear, but it may look \\na bit different from before. NDB: So where does that leave us\\nwith our two myths? Well, first of all,\\nif you have an elastic hymen, you will simply never bleed from sex. It doesn\\'t matter\\nif you\\'re a virgin or not. It\\'s an anatomical impossibility, and that is the case for half of you - except for the men amongst you, of course. (Laughter) So in other words, some virgins bleed,\\nbut some simply don\\'t, and that\\'s our first myth shattered. It naturally follows that you can\\'t examine the hymen\\nto check for virginity status. This was noted\\nover 100 years ago, in 1906, by the Norwegian Dr. Marie Jeancet. She examined a middle-aged sex worker and concluded that her genitalia\\nwere reminiscent of a teenage virgin. But that makes sense, right? Because, if her hymen\\nwas never damaged during sex, then what were we expecting to see? ESD: Since hymens come\\nin every shape and form, it is difficult to know if a dent or a fold in it\\nis there because of previous damage, or if it\\'s just a normal\\nanatomical variant. The absurdity of virgin testing is illustrated in a study\\ndone on 36 pregnant teenagers. When doctors examined their hymens, they could only find clear signs\\nof penetration in 2 out of the 36 girls. So unless you believe\\nin 34 cases of virgin births, (Laughter) we must all agree that also our 2nd myth\\nhas taken a vital blow. You simply cannot look a woman\\nbetween her legs and read her sexual story. NDB: Like most myths,\\nthe myths about the hymen are untrue. There is no virgin seal\\nthat magically disappears after sex, and half the virgins \\ncan easily have sex without bleeding. We wish we could say\\nthat by removing these myths, everything would be okay; that shame, harm and honor killings\\nwould all just disappear, but of course it\\'s not that simple. Sexual oppression of women\\ncomes from something much deeper than a simple anatomical misunderstanding\\nabout the properties of the hymen. It\\'s a question of cultural and religious\\ncontrol of women\\'s sexuality. And that is much harder to change,\\nbut we must try. ESD: As medical professionals, \\nthis is our contribution. We want every girl, parent,\\nand coming husband to know what the hymen is,\\nand how it works. We want them to know that the hymen\\ncan\\'t be used as a proof of virginity, and that way, we can remove one of the most powerful tools\\nused to control young women today. After telling you this, you may wonder what the alternative is. For if we cannot use the hymen\\nas a proof of virginity for women, then what should we use? We opt for using nothing. (Cheers) If you - (Applause) (Cheers) If you really want to know\\nif a woman is a virgin or not, ask her. (Laughter) But how she answers \\nthat question is her choice. Thank you. (Applause)', 'Translator: Joseph Geni\\nReviewer: Morton Bast Hello, Doha. Hello! Salaam alaikum. I love coming to Doha.\\nIt\\'s such an international place. It feels like the United Nations here. You land at the airport,\\nand you\\'re welcomed by an Indian lady who takes you to Al Maha Services,\\nwhere you meet a Filipino lady who hands you off to a South African lady who then takes you to a Korean who takes you to a Pakistani guy\\nwith the luggage who takes you to the car\\nwith a Sri Lankan. You go to the hotel and you check in.\\nThere\\'s a Lebanese. Yeah? And then a Swedish guy\\nshowed me my room. I said, \"Where are the Qataris?\" (Laughter) (Applause) They said, \"No, no, it\\'s too hot.\\nThey come out later. They\\'re smart.\" \"They know.\" (Laughter) And of course, it\\'s growing so fast,\\nsometimes there\\'s growing pains. You know, like sometimes\\nyou run into people that you think know the city well,\\nbut they don\\'t know it that well. My Indian cab driver showed up at the W, and I asked him to take me\\nto the Sheraton, and he said, \"No problem, sir.\" And then we sat there for two minutes. I said, \"What\\'s wrong?\"\\nHe said, \"One problem, sir.\" (Laughter) I said, \"What?\" He goes, \"Where is it?\" (Laughter) I go, \"You\\'re the driver,\\nyou should know.\" He goes, \"No, I just arrived, sir.\" I go, \"You just arrived at the W?\"\\n\"No, I just arrived in Doha, sir.\" (Laughter) \"I was on my way home from the airport, I got a job. I\\'m working already.\" (Laughter) He goes, \"Sir, why don\\'t you drive?\" (Laughter) \"I don\\'t know where we\\'re going.\" \"Neither do I. It will be\\nan adventure, sir.\" (Laughter) The Middle East has been\\nan adventure the past couple of years. It is going crazy with the Arab Spring\\nand revolution and all this. Are there any Lebanese\\nhere tonight, by applause? (Cheering) Lebanese, yeah. The Middle East is going crazy. You know the Middle East is going crazy when Lebanon is the most peaceful\\nplace in the region. (Laughter) (Applause) Who would have thought? (Laughter) Oh my gosh. No, there\\'s serious issues in the region. Some people don\\'t want to talk about them.\\nI\\'m here to talk about them tonight. Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East,\\nhere\\'s a serious issue. When we see each other, when we say hello, how many kisses are we going to do? (Laughter) Every country is different\\nand it\\'s confusing, okay? In Lebanon, they do three. In Egypt, they do two. I was in Lebanon, I got used to three. I went to Egypt. I went to say hello\\nto this one Egyptian guy, I went, one, two. I went for three -- He wasn\\'t into it. (Laughter) I told him, I said, \"No, no,\\nI was just in Lebanon.\" He goes, \"I don\\'t care where you were.\\nYou just stay where you are, please.\" (Laughter) (Applause) I went to Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two,\\nand then they stay on the same side: three, four, five, six,\\nseven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 -- (Laughter) Next time you see a Saudi, look closely. They\\'re just a little bit tilted. (Laughter) \"Abdul, are you okay?\" \"I was saying hello\\nfor half an hour. I\\'ll be all right.\" (Laughter) Qataris, you guys do the nose to nose. Why is that? Are you too tired\\nto go all the way around? (Laughter) \"Habibi, it\\'s so hot. Just come here\\nfor a second. Say hello. Hello, Habibi. Just don\\'t move.\\nJust stay there, please. I need to rest.\" (Laughter) Iranians, sometimes we do two,\\nsometimes we do three. A friend of mine explained to me,\\nbefore the \\'79 revolution, it was two. (Laughter) After the revolution, three. So with Iranians, you can tell\\nwhose side the person is on based on the number\\nof kisses they give you. Yeah, if you go one, two, three --\\n\"I can\\'t believe you support this regime!\" (Laughter) \"With your three kisses.\" (Laughter) But no, guys, really,\\nit is exciting to be here, and like I said, you guys\\nare doing a lot culturally, you know, and it\\'s amazing, and it helps change the image\\nof the Middle East in the West. A lot of Americans don\\'t know\\na lot about us, about the Middle East. I\\'m Iranian and American. I\\'m there.\\nI know, I\\'ve traveled here. There\\'s so much, we laugh, right? People don\\'t know we laugh. When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour,\\nit came out on Comedy Central, I went online to see\\nwhat people were saying. I ended up on a conservative website. One guy wrote another guy. He said,\\n\"I never knew these people laughed.\" Think about it. You never see us laughing\\nin American film or television, right? Maybe like an evil laugh: \"Wuhahaha.\" (Laughter) \"I will kill you in the name\\nof Allah, wuhahahahaha.\" (Laughter) But never like, \"Ha ha ha ha la.\" (Laughter) We like to laugh.\\nWe like to celebrate life. And I wish more Americans\\nwould travel here. I always encourage my friends: \"Travel, see the Middle East, there\\'s so much to see,\\nso many good people.\" And it\\'s vice versa,\\nand it helps stop problems of misunderstanding\\nand stereotypes from happening. For example, I don\\'t know\\nif you heard about this, a little while ago in the US,\\nthere was a Muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane, talking about the safest place\\nto sit on the plane. Some passengers overheard them, somehow misconstrued that\\nas terrorist talk, got them kicked off the plane. It was a family, a mother, father, child,\\ntalking about the seating. As a Middle Eastern male, I know there\\'s certain things\\nI\\'m not supposed to say on an airplane in the US, right? I\\'m not supposed to be\\nwalking down the aisle, and be like, \"Hi, Jack.\" That\\'s not cool. (Laughter) Even if I\\'m there with my friend\\nnamed Jack, I say, \"Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack.\" Never \"Hi, Jack.\" (Laughter) But now, apparently we can\\'t even talk about the safest place\\nto sit on an airplane. So my advice to all my Middle Eastern\\nfriends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks\\nMiddle Eastern or Muslim, so to, you know, Indians, and Latinos,\\neveryone, if you\\'re brown -- (Laughter) Here\\'s my advice to my brown friends. (Laughter) The next time you\\'re\\non an airplane in the US, just speak your mother tongue. That way no one knows\\nwhat you\\'re saying. Life goes on. (Laughter) Granted, some mother tongues\\nmight sound a little threatening to the average American. If you\\'re walking\\ndown the aisle speaking Arabic, you might freak them out -- (Imitating Arabic) They might say, \"What\\'s he talking about?\" The key, to my Arab brothers and sisters, is to throw in random\\ngood words to put people at ease as you\\'re walking down the aisle. Just as you\\'re walking down -- (Imitating Arabic) Strawberry! (Laughter) (Imitating Arabic) Rainbow! (Laughter) (Imitating Arabic) Tutti Frutti! (Laughter) \"I think he\\'s going to hijack\\nthe plane with some ice cream.\" Thank you very much. Have a good night. Thank you, TED. (Cheers) (Applause)', 'Why do we cheat? And why do happy people cheat? And when we say \"infidelity,\"\\nwhat exactly do we mean? Is it a hookup, a love story,\\npaid sex, a chat room, a massage with a happy ending? Why do we think that men cheat\\nout of boredom and fear of intimacy, but women cheat out of loneliness\\nand hunger for intimacy? And is an affair always\\nthe end of a relationship? For the past 10 years,\\nI have traveled the globe and worked extensively\\nwith hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity. There is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple\\nof their relationship, their happiness and their\\nvery identity: an affair. And yet, this extremely common\\nact is so poorly understood. So this talk is for anyone\\nwho has ever loved. Adultery has existed\\nsince marriage was invented, and so, too, the taboo against it. In fact, infidelity has a tenacity\\nthat marriage can only envy, so much so, that this is\\nthe only commandment that is repeated twice in the Bible: once for doing it, and once\\njust for thinking about it. (Laughter) So how do we reconcile\\nwhat is universally forbidden, yet universally practiced? Now, throughout history, men\\npractically had a license to cheat with little consequence, and supported by a host\\nof biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam, so the double standard\\nis as old as adultery itself. But who knows what\\'s really going on\\nunder the sheets there, right? Because when it comes to sex, the pressure for men\\nis to boast and to exaggerate, but the pressure for women\\nis to hide, minimize and deny, which isn\\'t surprising when you consider\\nthat there are still nine countries where women can be killed for straying. Now, monogamy used to be\\none person for life. Today, monogamy is one person at a time. (Laughter) (Applause) I mean, many of you probably have said, \"I am monogamous in all my relationships.\" (Laughter) We used to marry, and had sex for the first time. But now we marry, and we stop having sex with others. The fact is that monogamy\\nhad nothing to do with love. Men relied on women\\'s fidelity in order to know whose children these are, and who gets the cows when I die. Now, everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat. I\\'ve been asked that question\\nsince I arrived at this conference. (Laughter) It applies to you. But the definition of infidelity\\nkeeps on expanding: sexting, watching porn, staying\\nsecretly active on dating apps. So because there is no\\nuniversally agreed-upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity, estimates vary widely,\\nfrom 26 percent to 75 percent. But on top of it, we are\\nwalking contradictions. So 95 percent of us will say\\nthat it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie\\nabout having an affair, but just about the same\\namount of us will say that that\\'s exactly what we\\nwould do if we were having one. (Laughter) Now, I like this definition\\nof an affair -- it brings together the three key elements: a secretive relationship,\\nwhich is the core structure of an affair; an emotional connection\\nto one degree or another; and a sexual alchemy. And alchemy is the key word here, because the erotic frisson is such that\\nthe kiss that you only imagine giving, can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking. As Marcel Proust said, it\\'s our imagination that is responsible\\nfor love, not the other person. So it\\'s never been easier to cheat, and it\\'s never been more\\ndifficult to keep a secret. And never has infidelity exacted\\nsuch a psychological toll. When marriage was an economic enterprise, infidelity threatened\\nour economic security. But now that marriage\\nis a romantic arrangement, infidelity threatens\\nour emotional security. Ironically, we used to turn to adultery -- that was the space where\\nwe sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage, adultery destroys it. Now, there are three ways that I think\\ninfidelity hurts differently today. We have a romantic ideal\\nin which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs: to be my greatest lover, my best friend, the best parent, my trusted confidant, my emotional companion,\\nmy intellectual equal. And I am it: I\\'m chosen, I\\'m unique, I\\'m indispensable, I\\'m irreplaceable, I\\'m the one. And infidelity tells me I\\'m not. It is the ultimate betrayal. Infidelity shatters\\nthe grand ambition of love. But if throughout history,\\ninfidelity has always been painful, today it is often traumatic, because it threatens our sense of self. So my patient Fernando, he\\'s plagued. He goes on: \"I thought I knew my life. I thought I knew who you were,\\nwho we were as a couple, who I was. Now, I question everything.\" Infidelity -- a violation of trust,\\na crisis of identity. \"Can I ever trust you again?\" he asks. \"Can I ever trust anyone again?\" And this is also what my patient\\nHeather is telling me, when she\\'s talking to me\\nabout her story with Nick. Married, two kids. Nick just left on a business trip, and Heather is playing\\non his iPad with the boys, when she sees a message\\nappear on the screen: \"Can\\'t wait to see you.\" Strange, she thinks,\\nwe just saw each other. And then another message: \"Can\\'t wait to hold you in my arms.\" And Heather realizes these are not for her. She also tells me\\nthat her father had affairs, but her mother, she found\\none little receipt in the pocket, and a little bit of lipstick\\non the collar. Heather, she goes digging, and she finds hundreds of messages, and photos exchanged\\nand desires expressed. The vivid details\\nof Nick\\'s two-year affair unfold in front of her in real time, And it made me think: Affairs in the digital age\\nare death by a thousand cuts. But then we have another paradox\\nthat we\\'re dealing with these days. Because of this romantic ideal, we are relying on our partner\\'s\\nfidelity with a unique fervor. But we also have never\\nbeen more inclined to stray, and not because we have new desires today, but because we live in an era where we feel that we are\\nentitled to pursue our desires, because this is the culture\\nwhere I deserve to be happy. And if we used to divorce\\nbecause we were unhappy, today we divorce\\nbecause we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame, today, choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame. So Heather, she can\\'t talk to her friends because she\\'s afraid that they\\nwill judge her for still loving Nick, and everywhere she turns,\\nshe gets the same advice: Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb. And if the situation were reversed,\\nNick would be in the same situation. Staying is the new shame. So if we can divorce, why do we still have affairs? Now, the typical assumption\\nis that if someone cheats, either there\\'s something wrong\\nin your relationship or wrong with you. But millions of people\\ncan\\'t all be pathological. The logic goes like this: If you\\nhave everything you need at home, then there is no need\\nto go looking elsewhere, assuming that there is such\\na thing as a perfect marriage that will inoculate us against wanderlust. But what if passion\\nhas a finite shelf life? What if there are things\\nthat even a good relationship can never provide? If even happy people cheat, what is it about? The vast majority of people\\nthat I actually work with are not at all chronic philanderers. They are often people who are\\ndeeply monogamous in their beliefs, and at least for their partner. But they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior. They often are people who have\\nactually been faithful for decades, but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross, and at the risk of losing everything. But for a glimmer of what? Affairs are an act of betrayal, and they are also an expression\\nof longing and loss. At the heart of an affair,\\nyou will often find a longing and a yearning\\nfor an emotional connection, for novelty, for freedom,\\nfor autonomy, for sexual intensity, a wish to recapture\\nlost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back\\nvitality in the face of loss and tragedy. I\\'m thinking about\\nanother patient of mine, Priya, who is blissfully married, loves her husband, and would never want to hurt the man. But she also tells me that she\\'s always done\\nwhat was expected of her: good girl, good wife, good mother, taking care of her immigrant parents. Priya, she fell for the arborist\\nwho removed the tree from her yard after Hurricane Sandy. And with his truck and his tattoos,\\nhe\\'s quite the opposite of her. But at 47, Priya\\'s affair is about\\nthe adolescence that she never had. And her story highlights for me\\nthat when we seek the gaze of another, it isn\\'t always our partner\\nthat we are turning away from, but the person that\\nwe have ourselves become. And it isn\\'t so much that we\\'re\\nlooking for another person, as much as we are\\nlooking for another self. Now, all over the world, there is one word that people\\nwho have affairs always tell me. They feel alive. And they often will tell me\\nstories of recent losses -- of a parent who died, and a friend that went too soon, and bad news at the doctor. Death and mortality often live\\nin the shadow of an affair, because they raise these questions. Is this it? Is there more? Am I going on for another\\n25 years like this? Will I ever feel that thing again? And it has led me to think\\nthat perhaps these questions are the ones that propel\\npeople to cross the line, and that some affairs are\\nan attempt to beat back deadness, in an antidote to death. And contrary to what you may think, affairs are way less about sex,\\nand a lot more about desire: desire for attention,\\ndesire to feel special, desire to feel important. And the very structure of an affair, the fact that you can\\nnever have your lover, keeps you wanting. That in itself is a desire machine, because the incompleteness, the ambiguity, keeps you wanting\\nthat which you can\\'t have. Now some of you probably think that affairs don\\'t happen\\nin open relationships, but they do. First of all, the conversation\\nabout monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity. But the fact is that it seems\\nthat even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners, we still seem to be lured\\nby the power of the forbidden, that if we do that which\\nwe are not supposed to do, then we feel like we are really\\ndoing what we want to. And I\\'ve also told\\nquite a few of my patients that if they could bring\\ninto their relationships one tenth of the boldness,\\nthe imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs, they probably would never need to see me. (Laughter) So how do we heal from an affair? Desire runs deep. Betrayal runs deep. But it can be healed. And some affairs are death knells for relationships that were\\nalready dying on the vine. But others will jolt us\\ninto new possibilities. The fact is, the majority of couples who have experienced\\naffairs stay together. But some of them will merely survive, and others will actually be able\\nto turn a crisis into an opportunity. They\\'ll be able to turn this\\ninto a generative experience. And I\\'m actually thinking even\\nmore so for the deceived partner, who will often say, \"You think I didn\\'t want more? But I\\'m not the one who did it.\" But now that the affair is exposed, they, too, get to claim more, and they no longer have\\nto uphold the status quo that may not have been working\\nfor them that well, either. I\\'ve noticed that a lot of couples, in the immediate aftermath of an affair, because of this new disorder\\nthat may actually lead to a new order, will have depths of conversations\\nwith honesty and openness that they haven\\'t had in decades. And, partners who were\\nsexually indifferent find themselves suddenly\\nso lustfully voracious, they don\\'t know where it\\'s coming from. Something about the fear\\nof loss will rekindle desire, and make way for an entirely\\nnew kind of truth. So when an affair is exposed, what are some of the specific things\\nthat couples can do? We know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator\\nacknowledges their wrongdoing. So for the partner who had the affair, for Nick, one thing is to end the affair, but the other is the essential,\\nimportant act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife. But the truth is that I have noticed that quite a lot\\nof people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty\\nfor hurting their partner, but they don\\'t feel guilty\\nfor the experience of the affair itself. And that distinction is important. And Nick, he needs to hold\\nvigil for the relationship. He needs to become, for a while,\\nthe protector of the boundaries. It\\'s his responsibility to bring it up, because if he thinks about it, he can relieve Heather from the obsession, and from having to make sure\\nthat the affair isn\\'t forgotten, and that in itself\\nbegins to restore trust. But for Heather, or deceived partners, it is essential to do things\\nthat bring back a sense of self-worth, to surround oneself with love\\nand with friends and activities that give back joy\\nand meaning and identity. But even more important, is to curb the curiosity\\nto mine for the sordid details -- Where were you? Where did you do it? How often? Is she better\\nthan me in bed? -- questions that only inflict more pain, and keep you awake at night. And instead, switch to what I call\\nthe investigative questions, the ones that mine\\nthe meaning and the motives -- What did this affair mean for you? What were you able to express\\nor experience there that you could no longer do with me? What was it like for you\\nwhen you came home? What is it about us that you value? Are you pleased this is over? Every affair will redefine a relationship, and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be. But affairs are here to stay,\\nand they\\'re not going away. And the dilemmas of love and desire, they don\\'t yield just simple answers\\nof black and white and good and bad, and victim and perpetrator. Betrayal in a relationship\\ncomes in many forms. There are many ways\\nthat we betray our partner: with contempt, with neglect, with indifference, with violence. Sexual betrayal is only\\none way to hurt a partner. In other words, the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage. Now, you\\'ve listened to me, and I know what you\\'re thinking: She has a French accent,\\nshe must be pro-affair. (Laughter) So, you\\'re wrong. I am not French. (Laughter) (Applause) And I\\'m not pro-affair. But because I think that good\\ncan come out of an affair, I have often been asked\\nthis very strange question: Would I ever recommend it? Now, I would no more\\nrecommend you have an affair than I would recommend you have cancer, and yet we know that people\\nwho have been ill often talk about how their illness\\nhas yielded them a new perspective. The main question that I\\'ve been asked\\nsince I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk\\nabout infidelity is, for or against? I said, \"Yes.\" (Laughter) I look at affairs from a dual perspective: hurt and betrayal on one side, growth and self-discovery on the other -- what it did to you,\\nand what it meant for me. And so when a couple comes to me\\nin the aftermath of an affair that has been revealed, I will often tell them this: Today in the West, most of us are going to have\\ntwo or three relationships or marriages, and some of us are going\\nto do it with the same person. Your first marriage is over. Would you like to create\\na second one together? Thank you. (Applause)', 'Translator: Joseph Geni\\nReviewer: Morton Bast So, why does good sex so often fade, even for couples who continue\\nto love each other as much as ever? And why does good intimacy\\nnot guarantee good sex, contrary to popular belief? Or, the next question would be, can we want what we already have? That\\'s the million-dollar question, right? And why is the forbidden so erotic? What is it about transgression\\nthat makes desire so potent? And why does sex make babies, and babies spell erotic\\ndisaster in couples? (Laughter) It\\'s kind of the fatal\\nerotic blow, isn\\'t it? And when you love, how does it feel? And when you desire, how is it different? These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration\\non the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant\\ndilemmas in modern love. So I travel the globe, and what I\\'m noticing is that everywhere\\nwhere romanticism has entered, there seems to be a crisis of desire. A crisis of desire,\\nas in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression\\nof our individuality, of our free choice,\\nof our preferences, of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love\\nand individualistic societies. You know, this is the first time\\nin the history of humankind where we are trying to experience\\nsexuality in the long term not because we want 14 children, for which we need to have even more\\nbecause many of them won\\'t make it, and not because it is exclusively\\na woman\\'s marital duty. This is the first time\\nthat we want sex over time about pleasure and connection\\nthat is rooted in desire. So what sustains desire,\\nand why is it so difficult? And at the heart of sustaining\\ndesire in a committed relationship, I think, is the reconciliation\\nof two fundamental human needs. On the one hand, our need\\nfor security, for predictability, for safety, for dependability, for reliability, for permanence. All these anchoring,\\ngrounding experiences of our lives that we call home. But we also have an equally\\nstrong need -- men and women -- for adventure, for novelty, for mystery, for risk, for danger, for the unknown,\\nfor the unexpected, surprise -- you get the gist. For journey, for travel. So reconciling our need for security\\nand our need for adventure into one relationship, or what we today like to call\\na passionate marriage, used to be a contradiction in terms. Marriage was an economic institution in which you were\\ngiven a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner\\nto still give us all these things, but in addition I want you\\nto be my best friend and my trusted confidant\\nand my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long. (Laughter) So we come to one person,\\nand we basically are asking them to give us what once\\nan entire village used to provide. Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence\\nand mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort, give me edge. Give me novelty, give me familiarity. Give me predictability, give me surprise. And we think it\\'s a given, and toys and lingerie\\nare going to save us with that. (Laughter) (Applause) So now we get to the existential\\nreality of the story, right? Because I think, in some way -- and I\\'ll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire\\nis often a crisis of the imagination. So why does good sex so often fade? What is the relationship\\nbetween love and desire? How do they relate,\\nand how do they conflict? Because therein lies\\nthe mystery of eroticism. So if there is a verb, for me,\\nthat comes with love, it\\'s \"to have.\" And if there is a verb that comes\\nwith desire, it is \"to want.\" In love, we want to have,\\nwe want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap. We want to neutralize the tensions. We want closeness. But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back\\nto the places we\\'ve already gone. Forgone conclusion\\ndoes not keep our interest. In desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side\\nthat we can go visit, that we can go spend some time with, that we can go see what goes on\\nin their red-light district. You know? In desire, we want a bridge to cross. Or in other words,\\nI sometimes say, fire needs air. Desire needs space. And when it\\'s said like that,\\nit\\'s often quite abstract. But then I took a question with me. And I\\'ve gone to more than 20 countries\\nin the last few years with \"Mating in Captivity,\"\\nand I asked people, when do you find yourself\\nmost drawn to your partner? Not attracted sexually,\\nper Se, but most drawn. And across culture, across religion,\\nand across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers\\nthat just keep coming back. So the first group is: I am most drawn to my partner\\nwhen she is away, when we are apart, when we reunite. Basically, when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself\\nwith my partner, when my imagination comes\\nback in the picture, and when I can root it\\nin absence and in longing, which is a major component of desire. But then the second group\\nis even more interesting. I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio, when she is onstage, when he is in his element, when she\\'s doing something\\nshe\\'s passionate about, when I see him at a party\\nand other people are really drawn to him, when I see her hold court. Basically, when I look at my partner\\nradiant and confident. Probably the biggest\\nturn-on across the board. Radiant, as in self-sustaining. I look at this person --\\nby the way, in desire people rarely talk about it,\\nwhen we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other. I don\\'t know in inches how much that is. But it\\'s also not when the other person\\nis that far apart that you no longer see them. It\\'s when I\\'m looking at my partner\\nfrom a comfortable distance, where this person that is already\\nso familiar, so known, is momentarily once again\\nsomewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive. And in this space between me\\nand the other lies the erotic élan, lies that movement toward the other. Because sometimes, as Proust says, mystery is not\\nabout traveling to new places, but it\\'s about looking with new eyes. And so, when I see my partner\\non his own or her own, doing something\\nin which they are enveloped, I look at this person and I momentarily\\nget a shift in perception, and I stay open to the mysteries\\nthat are living right next to me. And then, more importantly,\\nin this description about the other or myself -- it\\'s the same -- what is most interesting\\nis that there is no neediness in desire. Nobody needs anybody. There is no caretaking in desire. Caretaking is mightily loving. It\\'s a powerful anti-aphrodisiac. (Laughter) I have yet to see somebody\\nwho is so turned on by somebody who needs them. Wanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shot down and women have known that forever, because anything\\nthat will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge. (Laughter) For good reasons, right? And then the third group\\nof answers usually would be: when I\\'m surprised,\\nwhen we laugh together, as somebody said to me\\nin the office today, when he\\'s in his tux, so I said, you know, it\\'s either the tux or the cowboy boots. But basically it\\'s when there is novelty. But novelty isn\\'t about new positions. It isn\\'t a repertoire of techniques. Novelty is, what parts\\nof you do you bring out? What parts of you are just being seen? Because in some way one could say\\nsex isn\\'t something you do, eh? Sex is a place you go. It\\'s a space you enter inside yourself\\nand with another, or others. So where do you go in sex? What parts of you do you connect to? What do you seek to express there? Is it a place for transcendence\\nand spiritual union? Is it a place for naughtiness\\nand is it a place to be safely aggressive? Is it a place where you\\ncan finally surrender and not have to take\\nresponsibility for everything? Is it a place where you can\\nexpress your infantile wishes? What comes out there? It\\'s a language. It isn\\'t just a behavior. And it\\'s the poetic of that language\\nthat I\\'m interested in, which is why I began to explore\\nthis concept of erotic intelligence. You know, animals have sex. It\\'s the pivot, it\\'s biology,\\nit\\'s the natural instinct. We are the only ones\\nwho have an erotic life, which means that it\\'s sexuality\\ntransformed by the human imagination. We are the only ones\\nwho can make love for hours, have a blissful time, multiple orgasms, and touch nobody,\\njust because we can imagine it. We can hint at it.\\nWe don\\'t even have to do it. We can experience that powerful\\nthing called anticipation, which is a mortar to desire. The ability to imagine it,\\nas if it\\'s happening, to experience it as if it\\'s happening, while nothing is happening and everything is happening,\\nat the same time. So when I began to think about eroticism, I began to think about the poetics of sex. And if I look at it as an intelligence, then it\\'s something that you cultivate. What are the ingredients? Imagination, playfulness, novelty, curiosity, mystery. But the central agent is really\\nthat piece called the imagination. But more importantly,\\nfor me to begin to understand who are the couples\\nwho have an erotic spark, what sustains desire, I had to go back\\nto the original definition of eroticism, the mystical definition, and I went through it\\nthrough a bifurcation by looking, actually, at trauma, which is the other side. And I looked at it, looking at the community\\nthat I had grown up in, which was a community in Belgium,\\nall Holocaust survivors, and in my community,\\nthere were two groups: those who didn\\'t die,\\nand those who came back to life. And those who didn\\'t die lived\\noften very tethered to the ground, could not experience\\npleasure, could not trust, because when you\\'re vigilant,\\nworried, anxious, and insecure, you can\\'t lift your head\\nto go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative. Those who came back to life were those who understood\\nthe erotic as an antidote to death. They knew how to keep themselves alive. And when I began to listen to the sexlessness\\nof the couples that I work with, I sometimes would hear people\\nsay, \"I want more sex,\" but generally, people want better sex, and better is to reconnect\\nwith that quality of aliveness, of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality, of Eros, of energy that sex used to afford them, or that they\\'ve hoped\\nit would afford them. And so I began to ask\\na different question. \"I shut myself off when ...\"\\nbegan to be the question. \"I turn off my desires when ...\" Which is not the same question as, \"What turns me off is ...\"\\nand \"You turn me off when ...\" And people began to say,\\n\"I turn myself off when I feel dead inside,\\nwhen I don\\'t like my body, when I feel old, when I haven\\'t had time for myself, when I haven\\'t had a chance\\nto even check in with you, when I don\\'t perform well at work, when I feel low self esteem, when I don\\'t have a sense of self-worth, when I don\\'t feel like I have\\na right to want, to take, to receive pleasure.\" And then I began to ask\\nthe reverse question. \"I turn myself on when ...\" Because most of the time,\\npeople like to ask the question, \"You turn me on, what turns me on,\" and I\\'m out of the question, you know? Now, if you are dead inside, the other person can do\\na lot of things for Valentine\\'s. It won\\'t make a dent.\\nThere is nobody at the reception desk. (Laughter) So I turn myself on when, I turn on my desires, I wake up when ... Now, in this paradox\\nbetween love and desire, what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients\\nthat nurture love -- mutuality, reciprocity, protection, worry,\\nresponsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients\\nthat stifle desire. Because desire comes\\nwith a host of feelings that are not always\\nsuch favorites of love: jealousy, possessiveness, aggression, power, dominance, naughtiness, mischief. Basically most of us will get turned on\\nat night by the very same things that we will demonstrate\\nagainst during the day. You know, the erotic mind\\nis not very politically correct. If everybody was fantasizing\\non a bed of roses, we wouldn\\'t be having such\\ninteresting talks about this. (Laughter) But no, in our mind up there\\nare a host of things going on that we don\\'t always know\\nhow to bring to the person that we love, because we think love\\ncomes with selflessness and in fact desire comes\\nwith a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word: the ability to stay connected\\nto one\\'s self in the presence of another. So I want to draw\\nthat little image for you, because this need to reconcile\\nthese two sets of needs, we are born with that. Our need for connection,\\nour need for separateness, or our need for security and adventure, or our need for togetherness\\nand for autonomy, and if you think about the little kid\\nwho sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here\\nand very secure and comfortable, and at some point all of us\\nneed to go out into the world to discover and to explore. That\\'s the beginning of desire, that exploratory need,\\ncuriosity, discovery. And then at some point they turn\\naround and they look at you. And if you tell them, \"Hey kiddo, the world\\'s a great place. Go for it. There\\'s so much fun out there,\" then they can turn away\\nand they can experience connection and separateness\\nat the same time. They can go off in their imagination,\\noff in their body, off in their playfulness, all the while knowing that there\\'s\\nsomebody when they come back. But if on this side\\nthere is somebody who says, \"I\\'m worried. I\\'m anxious. I\\'m depressed. My partner hasn\\'t taken care\\nof me in so long. What\\'s so good out there? Don\\'t we have everything\\nyou need together, you and I?\" then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize. Some of us will come back, came back a long time ago, and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo\\na part of himself in order not to lose the other. I will lose my freedom\\nin order not to lose connection. And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility\\nand extra protection, and I won\\'t know how to leave you in order to go play,\\nin order to go experience pleasure, in order to discover,\\nto enter inside myself. Translate this into adult language. It starts very young. It continues into our sex lives\\nup to the end. Child number two comes back but looks like that\\nover their shoulder all the time. \"Are you going to be there? Are you going to curse me, scold me? Are you going to be angry with me?\" And they may be gone,\\nbut they\\'re never really away. And those are often the people\\nthat will tell you, \"In the beginning, it was super hot.\" Because in the beginning, the growing intimacy wasn\\'t yet so strong that it actually led\\nto the decrease of desire. The more connected I became,\\nthe more responsible I felt, the less I was able to let go\\nin your presence. The third child doesn\\'t really come back. So what happens,\\nif you want to sustain desire, it\\'s that real dialectic piece. On the one hand you want the security\\nin order to be able to go. On the other hand if you can\\'t go,\\nyou can\\'t have pleasure, you can\\'t culminate,\\nyou don\\'t have an orgasm, you don\\'t get excited\\nbecause you spend your time in the body and the head\\nof the other and not in your own. So in this dilemma about reconciling\\nthese two sets of fundamental needs, there are a few things that I\\'ve come\\nto understand erotic couples do. One, they have a lot of sexual privacy. They understand\\nthat there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them. They also understand\\nthat foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing. Foreplay pretty much starts\\nat the end of the previous orgasm. They also understand\\nthat an erotic space isn\\'t about, you begin to stroke the other. It\\'s about you create a space\\nwhere you leave Management Inc., maybe where you leave the Agile program -- (Laughter) And you actually just enter that place\\nwhere you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things\\nand being responsible. Responsibility and desire just butt heads. They don\\'t really do well together. Erotic couples also understand\\nthat passion waxes and wanes. It\\'s pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses. But what they know\\nis they know how to resurrect it. They know how to bring it back. And they know how to bring it back because they have\\ndemystified one big myth, which is the myth of spontaneity, which is that it\\'s just going\\nto fall from heaven while you\\'re folding the laundry\\nlike a deus ex machina, and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen\\nin a long-term relationship, already has. Committed sex is premeditated sex. It\\'s willful. It\\'s intentional. It\\'s focus and presence. Merry Valentine\\'s. (Applause)', 'Namaskar. I\\'m a movie star, I\\'m 51 years of age, and I don\\'t use Botox as yet. (Laughter) So I\\'m clean, but I do behave like you saw\\nlike a 21-year-old in my movies. Yeah, I do that. I sell dreams, and I peddle love\\nto millions of people back home in India who assume that I\\'m\\nthe best lover in the world. (Laughter) If you don\\'t tell anyone,\\nI\\'m going to tell you I\\'m not, but I never let that assumption go away. (Laughter) I\\'ve also been made to understand there are lots of you here\\nwho haven\\'t seen my work, and I feel really sad for you. (Laughter) (Applause) That doesn\\'t take away from the fact\\nthat I\\'m completely self-obsessed, as a movie star should be. (Laughter) That\\'s when my friends,\\nChris and Juliet called me here to speak about the future \"you.\" Naturally, it follows I\\'m going\\nto speak about the present me. (Laughter) Because I truly believe\\nthat humanity is a lot like me. (Laughter) It is. It is. It\\'s an aging movie star, grappling with all\\nthe newness around itself, wondering whether\\nit got it right in the first place, and still trying to find a way to keep on shining regardless. I was born in a refugee colony\\nin the capital city of India, New Delhi. And my father was a freedom fighter. My mother was, well,\\njust a fighter like mothers are. And much like the original homo sapiens, we struggled to survive. When I was in my early 20s, I lost both my parents, which I must admit\\nseems a bit careless of me now, but -- (Laughter) I do remember the night my father died, and I remember the driver of a neighbor\\nwho was driving us to the hospital. He mumbled something\\nabout \"dead people don\\'t tip so well\" and walked away into the dark. And I was only 14 then, and I put my father\\'s dead body\\nin the back seat of the car, and my mother besides me, I started driving back\\nfrom the hospital to the house. And in the middle of her quiet crying,\\nmy mother looked at me and she said, \"Son, when did you learn to drive?\" And I thought about it\\nand realized, and I said to my mom, \"Just now, Mom.\" (Laughter) So from that night onwards, much akin to humanity in its adolescence, I learned the crude tools of survival. And the framework of life was\\nvery, very simple then, to be honest. You know, you just ate what you got and did whatever you were told to do. I thought celiac was a vegetable, and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock\\'s\\nlost comrade in \"Star Trek.\" (Laughter) You married the first girl that you dated, and you were a techie if you could fix\\nthe carburetor in your car. I really thought that gay was\\na sophisticated English word for happy. And Lesbian, of course, was the capital\\nof Portugal, as you all know. (Laughter) Where was I? We relied on systems created through the toil and sacrifice\\nof generations before to protect us, and we felt that governments\\nactually worked for our betterment. Science was simple and logical, Apple was still then just a fruit owned by Eve first and then Newton, not by Steve Jobs, until then. And \"Eureka!\" was what you screamed when you wanted\\nto run naked on the streets. You went wherever life took you for work, and people were mostly welcoming of you. Migration was a term then still reserved for Siberian cranes,\\nnot human beings. Most importantly, you were who you were and you said what you thought. Then in my late 20s, I shifted to the sprawling\\nmetropolis of Mumbai, and my framework, like the newly industrialized\\naspirational humanity, began to alter. In the urban rush for a new,\\nmore embellished survival, things started to look a little different. I met people who had descended\\nfrom all over the world, faces, races, genders, money-lenders. Definitions became more and more fluid. Work began to define you at that time in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner, and all the systems\\nstarted to feel less reliable to me, almost too thick to hold on to the diversity of mankind and the human need to progress and grow. Ideas were flowing\\nwith more freedom and speed. And I experienced the miracle\\nof human innovation and cooperation, and my own creativity, when supported by the resourcefulness\\nof this collective endeavor, catapulted me into superstardom. I started to feel that I had arrived, and generally, by the time I was 40,\\nI was really, really flying. I was all over the place. You know? I\\'d done 50 films by then and 200 songs, and I\\'d been knighted by the Malaysians. I had been given the highest civil honor\\nby the French government, the title of which for the life of me\\nI can\\'t pronounce even until now. (Laughter) I\\'m sorry, France, and thank you,\\nFrance, for doing that. But much bigger than that,\\nI got to meet Angelina Jolie -- (Laughter) for two and a half seconds. (Laughter) And I\\'m sure she also remembers\\nthat encounter somewhere. OK, maybe not. And I sat next to Hannah Montana\\non a round dinner table with her back towards me most of the time. Like I said, I was flying,\\nfrom Miley to Jolie, and humanity was soaring with me. We were both pretty much\\nflying off the handle, actually. And then you all know what happened. The internet happened. I was in my late 40s, and I started tweeting\\nlike a canary in a birdcage and assuming that, you know,\\npeople who peered into my world would admire it for the miracle I believed it to be. But something else\\nawaited me and humanity. You know, we had expected\\nan expansion of ideas and dreams with the enhanced\\nconnectivity of the world. We had not bargained\\nfor the village-like enclosure of thought, of judgment, of definition that flowed from the same place that freedom and revolution\\nwas taking place in. Everything I said took a new meaning. Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly -- was there for the world\\nto comment upon and judge. As a matter of fact,\\neverything I didn\\'t say or do also met with the same fate. Four years ago, my lovely wife Gauri and me\\ndecided to have a third child. It was claimed on the net that he was the love child of our first child who was 15 years old. Apparently, he had sown\\nhis wild oats with a girl while driving her car in Romania. And yeah, there was\\na fake video to go with it. And we were so disturbed as a family. My son, who is 19 now, even now when you say \"hello\" to him, he just turns around and says, \"But bro, I didn\\'t even have\\na European driving license.\" (Laughter) Yeah. In this new world, slowly, reality became virtual\\nand virtual became real, and I started to feel that I could not be who I wanted to be\\nor say what I actually thought, and humanity at this time completely identified with me. I think both of us\\nwere going through our midlife crisis, and humanity, like me,\\nwas becoming an overexposed prima donna. I started to sell everything, from hair oil to diesel generators. Humanity was buying everything from crude oil to nuclear reactors. You know, I even tried\\nto get into a skintight superhero suit to reinvent myself. I must admit I failed miserably. And just an aside I want to say\\non behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men and Supermen of the world, you have to commend them, because it really hurts in the crotch,\\nthat superhero suit. (Laughter) Yeah, I\\'m being honest.\\nI need to tell you this here. Really. And accidentally, I happened\\nto even invent a new dance form which I didn\\'t realize,\\nand it became a rage. So if it\\'s all right, and you\\'ve seen a bit of me,\\nso I\\'m quite shameless, I\\'ll show you. It was called the Lungi dance. So if it\\'s all right, I\\'ll just show you.\\nI\\'m talented otherwise. (Cheers) So it went something like this. Lungi dance. Lungi dance.\\nLungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance.\\nLungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance.\\nLungi dance. Lungi. That\\'s it. It became a rage. (Cheers) It really did. Like you notice, nobody could make\\nany sense of what was happening except me, and I didn\\'t give a damn, really, because the whole world,\\nand whole humanity, seemed as confused and lost as I was. I didn\\'t give up then. I even tried to reconstruct\\nmy identity on the social media like everyone else does. I thought if I put on\\nphilosophical tweets out there people will think I\\'m with it, but some of the responses I got\\nfrom those tweets were extremely confusing acronyms\\nwhich I didn\\'t understand. You know? ROFL, LOL. \"Adidas,\" somebody wrote back\\nto one of my more thought-provoking tweets and I was wondering\\nwhy would you name a sneaker, I mean, why would you write back\\nthe name of a sneaker to me? And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,\\nand she enlightened me. \"Adidas\" now means\\n\"All day I dream about sex.\" (Laughter) Really. I didn\\'t know if you know that. So I wrote back,\\n\"WTF\" in bold to Mr. Adidas, thanking secretly that some acronyms\\nand things won\\'t change at all. WTF. But here we are. I am 51 years old, like I told you, and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding, I just want to tell you if there has been a momentous time\\nfor humanity to exist, it is now, because the present you is brave. The present you is hopeful. The present you\\nis innovative and resourceful, and of course, the present you\\nis annoyingly indefinable. And in this spell-binding, imperfect moment of existence, feeling a little brave\\njust before I came here, I decided to take\\na good, hard look at my face. And I realized that I\\'m beginning\\nto look more and more like the wax statue of me\\nat Madame Tussaud\\'s. (Laughter) Yeah, and in that moment of realization, I asked the most central\\nand pertinent question to humanity and me: Do I need to fix my face? Really. I\\'m an actor, like I told you, a modern expression of human creativity. The land I come from is the source of inexplicable\\nbut very simple spirituality. In its immense generosity, India decided somehow that I, the Muslim son\\nof a broke freedom fighter who accidentally ventured\\ninto the business of selling dreams, should become its king of romance, the \"Badhshah of Bollywood,\" the greatest lover\\nthe country has ever seen ... with this face. Yeah. (Laughter) Which has alternately\\nbeen described as ugly, unconventional, and strangely, not chocolatey enough. (Laughter) The people of this ancient land embraced me in their limitless love, and I\\'ve learned from these people that neither power nor poverty can make your life more magical or less tortuous. I\\'ve learned from the people of my country that the dignity of a life, a human being, a culture,\\na religion, a country actually resides in its ability for grace and compassion. I\\'ve learned that whatever moves you, whatever urges you to create, to build, whatever keeps you from failing, whatever helps you survive, is perhaps the oldest and the simplest\\nemotion known to mankind, and that is love. A mystic poet from my land famously wrote, (Recites poem in Hindi) (Poem ends) Which loosely translates\\ninto that whatever -- yeah, if you know Hindi,\\nplease clap, yeah. (Applause) It\\'s very difficult to remember. Which loosely translates\\ninto actually saying that all the books of knowledge\\nthat you might read and then go ahead\\nand impart your knowledge through innovation,\\nthrough creativity, through technology, but mankind will never be\\nthe wiser about its future unless it is coupled with a sense of love\\nand compassion for their fellow beings. The two and a half alphabets\\nwhich form the word \"प्रेम,\" which means \"love,\" if you are able to understand that and practice it, that itself is enough\\nto enlighten mankind. So I truly believe the future \"you\" has to be a you that loves. Otherwise it will cease to flourish. It will perish in its own self-absorption. So you may use your power to build walls and keep people outside, or you may use it to break barriers\\nand welcome them in. You may use your faith to make people afraid and terrify them into submission, or you can use it\\nto give courage to people so they rise to the greatest\\nheights of enlightenment. You can use your energy to build nuclear bombs\\nand spread the darkness of destruction, or you can use it to spread\\nthe joy of light to millions. You may filthy up the oceans callously\\nand cut down all the forests. You can destroy the ecology, or turn to them with love and regenerate life\\nfrom the waters and trees. You may land on Mars and build armed citadels, or you may look for life-forms and species\\nto learn from and respect. And you can use\\nall the moneys we all have earned to wage futile wars and give guns in the hands\\nof little children to kill each other with, or you can use it to make more food to fill their stomachs with. My country has taught me the capacity for a human being to love\\nis akin to godliness. It shines forth in a world which civilization, I think,\\nalready has tampered too much with. In the last few days,\\nthe talks here, the wonderful people coming and showing their talent, talking about individual achievements,\\nthe innovation, the technology, the sciences, the knowledge\\nwe are gaining by being here in the presence of TED Talks\\nand all of you are reasons enough\\nfor us to celebrate the future \"us.\" But within that celebration the quest to cultivate\\nour capacity for love and compassion has to assert itself,\\nhas to assert itself, just as equally. So I believe the future \"you\" is an infinite you. It\\'s called a chakra\\nin India, like a circle. It ends where it begins from\\nto complete itself. A you that perceives\\ntime and space differently understands both your unimaginable and fantastic importance and your complete unimportance\\nin the larger context of the universe. A you that returns back to the original innocence of humanity, which loves from the purity of heart, which sees from the eyes of truth, which dreams from the clarity\\nof an untampered mind. The future \"you\" has to be like an aging movie star who has been made to believe\\nthat there is a possibility of a world which is completely, wholly, self-obsessively in love with itself. A world -- really, it has to be a you to create a world which is its own best lover. That I believe, ladies and gentlemen, should be the future \"you.\" Thank you very much. Shukriya. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)', 'What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become\\na multibillion-dollar industry. Inspection, environmental monitoring,\\nphotography and film and journalism: these are some of the potential\\napplications for commercial drones, and their enablers\\nare the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world. For example, before aerial\\npackage delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines\\nbuilt a six-meter-tall tower composed of 1,500 bricks in front of a live audience\\nat the FRAC Centre in France, and several years ago,\\nthey started to fly with ropes. By tethering flying machines, they can achieve high speeds\\nand accelerations in very tight spaces. They can also autonomously build\\ntensile structures. Skills learned include how to carry loads, how to cope with disturbances, and in general, how to interact\\nwith the physical world. Today we want to show you some\\nnew projects that we\\'ve been working on. Their aim is to push the boundary\\nof what can be achieved with autonomous flight. Now, for a system to function\\nautonomously, it must collectively know the location\\nof its mobile objects in space. Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras\\nto locate objects, which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development\\nof highly dynamic tasks. For the demos you will see today, however, we will use new localization technology\\ndeveloped by Verity Studios, a spin-off from our lab. There are no external cameras. Each flying machine uses onboard sensors\\nto determine its location in space and onboard computation\\nto determine what its actions should be. The only external commands\\nare high-level ones such as \"take off\" and \"land.\" This is a so-called tail-sitter. It\\'s an aircraft that tries\\nto have its cake and eat it. Like other fixed-wing aircraft,\\nit is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters\\nand variations thereof. Unlike most other\\nfixed-wing aircraft, however, it is capable of hovering, which has huge advantages\\nfor takeoff, landing and general versatility. There is no free lunch, unfortunately. One of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they\\'re susceptible\\nto disturbances such as wind gusts. We\\'re developing new control\\narchitectures and algorithms that address this limitation. The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in, and through practice,\\nimprove its performance over time. (Applause) OK. When doing research, we often ask ourselves\\nfundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter. For example, one such question would be, what is the minimum number of moving parts\\nneeded for controlled flight? Now, there are practical reasons why you may want to know\\nthe answer to such a question. Helicopters, for example, are affectionately known\\nas machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm. It turns out that decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly\\nremote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder. We recently discovered\\nthat it could be done with just one. This is the monospinner, the world\\'s mechanically simplest\\ncontrollable flying machine, invented just a few months ago. It has only one moving part, a propeller. It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons, no other actuators,\\nno other control surfaces, just a simple propeller. Even though it\\'s mechanically simple, there\\'s a lot going on\\nin its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion\\nand to move anywhere it wants in space. Even so, it doesn\\'t yet have the sophisticated algorithms\\nof the tail-sitter, which means that in order\\nto get it to fly, I have to throw it just right. And because the probability\\nof me throwing it just right is very low, given everybody watching me, what we\\'re going to do instead is show you a video\\nthat we shot last night. (Laughter) (Applause) If the monospinner\\nis an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter,\\nwith its eight propellers, is an exercise in excess. What can you do with all this surplus? The thing to notice\\nis that it is highly symmetric. As a result, it is ambivalent\\nto orientation. This gives it an extraordinary capability. It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating. It has its own complexities, mainly having to do\\nwith the interacting flows from its eight propellers. Some of this can be modeled,\\nwhile the rest can be learned on the fly. Let\\'s take a look. (Applause) If flying machines are going\\nto enter part of our daily lives, they will need to become\\nextremely safe and reliable. This machine over here is actually two separate\\ntwo-propeller flying machines. This one wants to spin clockwise. This other one wants\\nto spin counterclockwise. When you put them together, they behave like one\\nhigh-performance quadrocopter. If anything goes wrong, however -- a motor fails, a propeller fails,\\nelectronics, even a battery pack -- the machine can still fly,\\nalbeit in a degraded fashion. We\\'re going to demonstrate this to you now\\nby disabling one of its halves. (Applause) This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms. The large number of autonomous,\\ncoordinated entities offers a new palette\\nfor aesthetic expression. We\\'ve taken commercially available\\nmicro quadcopters, each weighing less\\nthan a slice of bread, by the way, and outfitted them\\nwith our localization technology and custom algorithms. Because each unit\\nknows where it is in space and is self-controlled, there is really no limit to their number. (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) Hopefully, these demonstrations\\nwill motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles\\nfor flying machines. That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become\\na flying lampshade on Broadway. (Laughter) The reality is that it is\\ndifficult to predict the impact of nascent technology. And for folks like us, the real reward\\nis the journey and the act of creation. It\\'s a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical\\nthe universe we live in is, that it allows creative, clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways. The fact that this technology has such huge commercial\\nand economic potential is just icing on the cake. Thank you. (Applause)', 'So I would like to discuss\\nabout meditation. But first of all, I\\'d like to ask you\\na very simple question. Can you see my hand? Yes, raise your hand. Audience: Yes. Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche:\\nOK, can you hear me? Audience: Yes. YMR: Yes? Great. That is the meditation. So, finished. My TED Talk is finished. (Laughter and applause) Of course, I\\'m just kidding. But in a way that is true. Why? What we call the essence\\nof meditation is awareness. And what is awareness? Knows what you are thinking, feeling, doing, seeing, hearing. That\\'s all. So actually meditation is very easy, but many people find it difficult. Why? There are two misunderstandings\\nabout meditation. So the first is many people think\\nmeditation means, think of nothing, stop thinking, concentration. Ah. (Laughter) Shh! I\\'m meditating, keep quiet. (Laughter) So the more, when you try to stop thinking what happens, you will think more. So we will do a small experiment, OK? Now, please don\\'t think about pizza. (Laughter) No pizza. No pizza. What happened? Did you think about pizza or not? Yes, raise your hand. (Laughter) I know. (Laughter) Actually, we don\\'t need to stop thinking. We just need to connect with awareness. And another misunderstanding\\nabout meditation is what we call “blissing out.” Looking for peace, calm, joy, relax. (Laughter) The more you look for relax, then peace, calm, joy, relax run away. So ... Let me share [with] you my own experience. When I was young, I had panic attacks. Although I was born right in the middle\\nof the Himalayan mountains, the area, the village, wonderful, but panic followed me like a shadow. And I have so much fear [of] strangers,\\nI cannot go out and meet people. And lot of storms\\nin the Himalayan mountains, thunderstorm, snowstorm. These storms drive me crazy. And when I was nine years old, I asked my father to teach me meditation. Luckily, he was a great\\nmeditation teacher. And the first thing what he said is, \"Don\\'t try to fight with the panic. Don\\'t try to get rid of panic.\" \"And actually,\" he said,\\n\"you don\\'t have to.\" Why? Awareness is like sky in the mountain, and the panic is like storm\\nin the mountain, like cloud. And no matter how strong a storm is, it doesn\\'t change the nature of sky. So sky is always present, pure, calm. Similarly, our fundamental quality\\nof mind, awareness is always present, pure, calm. But the problem is we don\\'t know\\nhow to connect with awareness, what we see, only a thought, emotion, that\\'s all. So he said, there are three steps\\nof practice to connect with awareness. The first one, we have to use an object. Support, to connect with awareness. So this is one of my first\\nmeditation techniques that I learned from my father. So you can join and you can relax\\nyour muscles in your body. If you cannot relax, also OK, allowed. (Laughter) And close your eyes,\\nand please listen to sound. (Ding) And when you hear the sound, through ear and mind together ... (Ding) That is the meditation. And let panic come and go. Let pizza come and go. (Ding) And maybe two pizzas,\\nthree pizzas, ten pizzas. As long as you remember the sound, you can have pizza. (Ding) (Ding) (Ding) OK, how was it? Did you hear the sound? Yes, raise your hand. Great. That is the meditation. Very easy. Just hear, that\\'s all. You don\\'t have to do anything. So if panic comes,\\nlet panic come and go, don\\'t care. Just listen to sound. Monkey mind comes blah, blah, blah. Let it come and go, just listen to sound. So I did that. But I had a big problem. The problem is lazy. (Laughter) I\\'m lazy boy, I love\\nthe idea of meditation, but I don\\'t like the practice\\nof meditation. So on and off like that for five years. When I was 13 years old in India, there\\'s traditional three-year\\nretreat going to start. I thought I should join this\\nbecause it\\'s good for my laziness. And I join. The first month, wonderful, no lazy. Second month, lazy come back. (Laughter) Now what happened? My lazy and my panic,\\nthey two become good friends. (Laughter) The life in the retreat becomes disaster. And I thought I should leave. But I feel embarrassed to leave because I told all my childhood friends\\nthat I can do the retreat, you know. I don\\'t want to lose my face. But if I stay, almost three years to go. Then I thought, what should I do? In the end, I decided to learn\\nhow to live with the panic. So now we have\\nthe second step what we call, actually, we can meditate everywhere, anytime with anything. So you can meditate with panic. How do you do that? Just like listen to sound, when you listen to sound, sound becomes support for your meditation. Now you\\'re going to watch panic. If you see the panic, great. What we call, when you see the river,\\nyou\\'re out of the river. When you see the mountain,\\nyou\\'re out of the montain. So now awareness becomes more than panic. More than depression, stress. Monkey mind, whatever. Let them come, let them go. So that is the first benefit\\nand second benefit of what we call, there\\'s a wisdom comes. So when you look at the panic, panic is not solid stone anymore. Panic becomes pieces. Sensation here, frightening image,\\nvoice, background belief. And if you take one of these away,\\nyou cannot find panic. So what I call panic\\nbecomes like shaving foam, looks like a piece of rock\\nbut inside full of bubbles. Then three, what I call\\nthis is acceptance, like self-kind, self-love,\\nself-compassion. You let panic come and go, that\\'s the real acceptance, isn\\'t it? So three in one: awareness, love and compassion, wisdom. Sometimes what I call\\nbuy one, get two free. (Laughter) Big deal, right? And all this because of panic. So now panic becomes your teacher, your best friend. So I did this practice and in the end, me and my panic become very good friends. And few weeks later, panic is gone. I miss my friend. And I finished my retreat,\\nmy retreat went very well. And after that I have been eager to share\\nthis wonderful technique with the world. So I taught meditation many places, wrote three books, become bestseller, and then students and become\\nabbot of a few monasteries. And what happened? Kind of new ego emerged within me. I thought, oh,\\nI have to watch out, this so. Then I decided to do\\nsomething very special, what we call wandering retreat. Meaning you leave everything behind, go on the street with nothing. So I decided to do that. In 2011, I left my monastery, my students, my wonderful cozy bed. Everything, and got on street\\nwith only a few thousand Indian rupees, and that finished within a few weeks. Now I have to beg for food. And I got food poisoning. Vomiting, diarrhea. I\\'m alone on the street, now I\\'m going to die. Then I thought, what should I do? So now we have the third step, what we call open awareness meditation. Awareness, be with itself. Sky, be with itself. Now, no need to have support. Just be awareness itself. I did that practice. Then what happened? My body become decayed, I cannot see, I cannot hear. But my mind becomes so present, beyond free. And I was in that state for a few hours. Luckily, I didn\\'t die, I come back. So when I come back,\\nthe street becomes like my home. When I look at a tree,\\ntree becomes like tree of love. And the wind blows to my face\\nbecome a joyful experience. And the rest of my retreat went very well. I learned a lot from my retreat. So I like to share this open\\nawareness meditation, but it is very difficult to explain. But I want to do something drama. And this is what I learned from my father. So what we call, this mala\\nis the crazy monkey mind, blah, blah, blah, yada yada. And the open awareness meditation\\nmeans you don\\'t have to do anything. Just be. That\\'s all, and you don\\'t\\nneed to meditate. The sense of presence,\\nbeing, but not loss. Be free. Be present. Thank you very much. (Applause)', 'Translator: Joseph Geni\\nReviewer: Morton Bast I\\'m a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist, I\\'m actually interested in how the brain learns, and I\\'m especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter, better and faster. This is in this context I\\'m going to tell you about video games. When we say video games, most of you think about children. It\\'s true. Ninety percent of children do play video games. But let\\'s be frank. When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation? Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old, not eight years old, and in fact, if we look at the projected demographics of video game play, the video game players of tomorrow are older adults. (Laughter) So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society. It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game \"Call Of Duty: Black Ops,\" it had been played for 68,000 years worldwide, right? Would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra? So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power? Now I want to step back a bit. I know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games. (Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you, right? And I\\'m almost sure most of you have thought, \"Oh, come on, can\\'t you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies?\" I\\'d like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right? Most parents would find that great. Well, I\\'m not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health. It\\'s not, and binging is never good. But I\\'m going to argue that in reasonable doses, actually the very game I showed you at the beginning, those action-packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior. There\\'s not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you, right? You\\'re all bombarded with that. I\\'d like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab. What we do in the lab is actually measure directly, in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact of video games on the brain. And so I\\'m going to take a few examples from our work. One first saying that I\\'m sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse. That\\'s a statement about vision. There may be vision scientists among you. We actually know how to test that statement. We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is. Well, guess what? People that don\\'t play a lot of action games, that don\\'t actually spend a lot of time in front of screens, have normal, or what we call corrective-to-normal vision. That\\'s okay. The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week, 10 hours per week, 15 hours per week. By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right? Guess what? Their vision is really, really good. It\\'s better than those that don\\'t play. And it\\'s better in two different ways. The first way is that they\\'re actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it with just your eyesight. The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray. Imagine you\\'re driving in a fog. That makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident. So we\\'re actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision, and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better. Clearly, when it comes to action video games, screen time doesn\\'t make your eyesight worse. Another saying that I\\'m sure you have all heard around: Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability. Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab. I\\'m actually going to give you an example of how we do so. I\\'m going to ask you to participate, so you\\'re going to have to actually play the game with me. I\\'m going to show you colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink. Right? So this is the first example. [\"Chair\"] Orange, good. [\"Table\"] Green. [\"Board\"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red. [\"Horse\"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow. [\"Yellow\"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow. [\"Blue\"] DB: Yellow. Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter) You\\'re getting better, but it\\'s hard. Why is it hard? Because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color. How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better than some of us that are older. What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games, they actually resolve the conflict faster. So clearly playing those action games doesn\\'t lead to attention problems. Actually, those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention, and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world. This is something we use all the time. When you\\'re driving, you\\'re tracking, keeping track of the cars around you. You\\'re also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog, and that\\'s how you can actually be safe driving, right? In the lab, we get people to come to the lab, sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them little tasks that I\\'m going to get you to do again. You\\'re going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces. These are children in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess during the winter. Most kids are happy. It\\'s actually recess. But a few kids are sad and blue because they\\'ve forgotten their coat. Everybody begins to move around, and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn\\'t. So I\\'m just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid. It\\'s easy because you can actually track it with your eyes. You can track, you can track, and then when it stops, and there is a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not? Was it yellow initially or blue? I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter) I\\'m now going to ask you to do the task, but now with a little more challenging task. There are going to be three of them that are blue. Don\\'t move your eyes. Please don\\'t move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated and expand, pull your attention. That\\'s the only way you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you\\'re doomed. Yellow or blue? Audience: Yellow.DB: Good. So your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention. That\\'s what we just did. Your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention, which is what is shown in this video here. That\\'s for you guys, action video game players. A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter) Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people that are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter) Good. So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people\\'s behavior, we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes, but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention. The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls how we sustain attention, and another one is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict. Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games. This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain. You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty of multitasking when you\\'re driving and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea. Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone, you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you, and so you\\'re much more likely to get engaged into a car accident. Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab. We obviously don\\'t ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy, how good they are at switching from one task to another. When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good. They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost. Now I\\'d like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking. What is multimedia-tasking? It\\'s the fact that most of us, most of our children, are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they\\'re doing search on the web at the same time as they\\'re chatting on Facebook with their friends. That\\'s a multimedia-tasker. There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking. When we measure them in the lab, they\\'re really bad. Right? So these kinds of results really makes two main points. The first one is that not all media are created equal. You can\\'t compare the effect of multimedia-tasking and the effect of playing action games. They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition, perception and attention. Even within video games, I\\'m telling you right now about these action-packed video games. Different video games have a different effect on your brains. So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game. The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight. I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers have a lot of very good vision, etc. Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test. So you show them their data, you show them they are bad and they\\'re like, \"Not possible.\" You know, they have this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good. That\\'s another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain. Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it\\'s very similar to the effect of wine on the health. There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some very poor uses of video games. But when consumed in reasonable doses, and at the right age, wine can be very good for health. There are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy. So it\\'s the same way, like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention, vision, etc., and so we need and we\\'re working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games, either for education or for rehabilitation of patients. Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform. I\\'m much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game, I can actually change your vision for the better, whether you want to play that action game or not, right? That\\'s the point of rehabilitation or education. Most of the kids don\\'t go to school saying, \"Great, two hours of math!\" So that\\'s really the crux of the research, and to do that, we need to go one more step. And one more step is to do training studies. So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation. Mental rotation is a task where I\\'m going to ask you, and again you\\'re going to do the task, to look at this shape. Study it, it\\'s a target shape, and I\\'m going to present to you four different shapes. One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one: the first one, second one, third one or fourth one? Okay, I\\'ll help you. Fourth one. One more. Get those brains working. Come on. That\\'s our target shape. Third. Good! This is hard, right? Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing, right? It doesn\\'t really feel like playing mindless action video games. Well, what we do in these training studies is, people come to the lab, they do tasks like this one, we then force them to play 10 hours of action games. They don\\'t play 10 hours of action games in a row. They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks. Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially, you know, subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age. After two weeks of training on action video games, they actually perform better, and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training. That\\'s really, really important. Why? Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects that are going to be long-lasting. Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy, or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example? Well, we\\'re working on it, but here is a challenge. There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects, and that\\'s what I\\'m going to call the broccoli side of the equation. There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can\\'t resist. That\\'s the chocolate side of the equation. The issue is we need to put the two together, and it\\'s a little bit like with food. Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli? None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had that feeling, right, picking up an education game and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it\\'s not really fun, it\\'s not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate that is irresistible, that you really want to play, but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can\\'t recognize but are still working on your brains. And we\\'re working on it, but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together, people that work in the entertainment software industry, and publishers, so these are not people that usually meet every day, but it\\'s actually doable, and we are on the right track. I\\'d like to leave you with that thought, and thank you for your attention. (Applause) (Applause)', 'Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors\\nwere insignificant animals. The most important thing to know\\nabout prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was not\\nmuch greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers. Today, in contrast,\\nwe control this planet. And the question is: How did we come from there to here? How did we turn ourselves\\nfrom insignificant apes, minding their own business\\nin a corner of Africa, into the rulers of planet Earth? Usually, we look for the difference\\nbetween us and all the other animals on the individual level. We want to believe -- I want to believe -- that there is something special about me, about my body, about my brain, that makes me so superior\\nto a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee. But the truth is that,\\non the individual level, I\\'m embarrassingly similar\\nto a chimpanzee. And if you take me and a chimpanzee\\nand put us together on some lonely island, and we had to struggle for survival\\nto see who survives better, I would definitely place my bet\\non the chimpanzee, not on myself. And this is not something\\nwrong with me personally. I guess if they took almost any one\\nof you, and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island, the chimpanzee would do much better. The real difference between humans\\nand all other animals is not on the individual level; it\\'s on the collective level. Humans control the planet\\nbecause they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly\\nand in very large numbers. Now, there are other animals -- like the social insects,\\nthe bees, the ants -- that can cooperate in large numbers,\\nbut they don\\'t do so flexibly. Their cooperation is very rigid. There is basically just one way\\nin which a beehive can function. And if there\\'s a new opportunity\\nor a new danger, the bees cannot reinvent\\nthe social system overnight. They cannot, for example,\\nexecute the queen and establish a republic of bees, or a communist dictatorship\\nof worker bees. Other animals, like the social mammals -- the wolves, the elephants,\\nthe dolphins, the chimpanzees -- they can cooperate much more flexibly, but they do so only in small numbers, because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge,\\none of the other. I\\'m a chimpanzee and you\\'re a chimpanzee, and I want to cooperate with you. I need to know you personally. What kind of chimpanzee are you? Are you a nice chimpanzee? Are you an evil chimpanzee? Are you trustworthy? If I don\\'t know you, how can I\\ncooperate with you? The only animal that can combine\\nthe two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly\\nand still do so in very large numbers is us, Homo sapiens. One versus one, or even 10 versus 10, chimpanzees might be better than us. But, if you pit 1,000 humans\\nagainst 1,000 chimpanzees, the humans will win easily,\\nfor the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees\\ncannot cooperate at all. And if you now try to cram\\n100,000 chimpanzees into Oxford Street,\\nor into Wembley Stadium, or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican, you will get chaos, complete chaos. Just imagine Wembley Stadium\\nwith 100,000 chimpanzees. Complete madness. In contrast, humans normally\\ngather there in tens of thousands, and what we get is not chaos, usually. What we get is extremely sophisticated\\nand effective networks of cooperation. All the huge achievements\\nof humankind throughout history, whether it\\'s building the pyramids\\nor flying to the moon, have been based not\\non individual abilities, but on this ability to cooperate\\nflexibly in large numbers. Think even about this very talk\\nthat I\\'m giving now: I\\'m standing here in front of an audience\\nof about 300 or 400 people, most of you are complete strangers to me. Similarly, I don\\'t really know\\nall the people who have organized and worked on this event. I don\\'t know the pilot\\nand the crew members of the plane that brought me over here,\\nyesterday, to London. I don\\'t know the people\\nwho invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras,\\nwhich are recording what I\\'m saying. I don\\'t know the people\\nwho wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk. And I certainly don\\'t know all the people who might be watching this talk\\nover the Internet, somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi. Nevertheless, even though\\nwe don\\'t know each other, we can work together to create\\nthis global exchange of ideas. This is something chimpanzees cannot do. They communicate, of course, but you will never catch a chimpanzee\\ntraveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas\\nor about elephants, or anything else that might\\ninterest chimpanzees. Now cooperation is, of course,\\nnot always nice; all the horrible things humans\\nhave been doing throughout history -- and we have been doing\\nsome very horrible things -- all those things are also based\\non large-scale cooperation. Prisons are a system of cooperation; slaughterhouses are a system\\nof cooperation; concentration camps\\nare a system of cooperation. Chimpanzees don\\'t have slaughterhouses\\nand prisons and concentration camps. Now suppose I\\'ve managed\\nto convince you perhaps that yes, we control the world because we can\\ncooperate flexibly in large numbers. The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is: How, exactly, do we do it? What enables us alone, of all the animals,\\nto cooperate in such a way? The answer is our imagination. We can cooperate flexibly\\nwith countless numbers of strangers, because we alone, of all\\nthe animals on the planet, can create and believe fictions,\\nfictional stories. And as long as everybody believes\\nin the same fiction, everybody obeys and follows\\nthe same rules, the same norms, the same values. All other animals use\\ntheir communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say, \"Look!\\nThere\\'s a lion, let\\'s run away!\" Or, \"Look! There\\'s a banana tree\\nover there! Let\\'s go and get bananas!\" Humans, in contrast, use their language\\nnot merely to describe reality, but also to create new realities,\\nfictional realities. A human can say, \"Look,\\nthere is a god above the clouds! And if you don\\'t do what I tell you to do, when you die, God will punish you\\nand send you to hell.\" And if you all believe this story\\nthat I\\'ve invented, then you will follow the same\\nnorms and laws and values, and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee\\nto give you a banana by promising him, \"... after you die,\\nyou\\'ll go to chimpanzee heaven ...\" (Laughter) \"... and you\\'ll receive lots and lots\\nof bananas for your good deeds. So now give me this banana.\" No chimpanzee will ever\\nbelieve such a story. Only humans believe such stories, which is why we control the world, whereas the chimpanzees are locked up\\nin zoos and research laboratories. Now you may find it acceptable that yes, in the religious field, humans cooperate\\nby believing in the same fictions. Millions of people come together\\nto build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because\\nthey all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell. But what I want to emphasize\\nis that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms\\nof mass-scale human cooperation, not only in the religious field. Take, for example, the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world\\nare based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights? Human rights, just like God and heaven,\\nare just a story that we\\'ve invented. They are not an objective reality; they are not some biological effect\\nabout homo sapiens. Take a human being,\\ncut him open, look inside, you will find the heart, the kidneys,\\nneurons, hormones, DNA, but you won\\'t find any rights. The only place you find rights\\nare in the stories that we have invented and spread around\\nover the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories,\\nvery good stories, but they\\'re still just fictional stories\\nthat we\\'ve invented. The same is true of the political field. The most important factors\\nin modern politics are states and nations. But what are states and nations? They are not an objective reality. A mountain is an objective reality. You can see it, you can touch it,\\nyou can even smell it. But a nation or a state, like Israel or Iran or France or Germany, this is just a story that we\\'ve invented and became extremely attached to. The same is true of the economic field. The most important actors today\\nin the global economy are companies and corporations. Many of you today, perhaps, work\\nfor a corporation, like Google or Toyota or McDonald\\'s. What exactly are these things? They are what lawyers call legal fictions. They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. (Laughter) And what do corporations do all day? Mostly, they try to make money. Yet, what is money? Again, money is not an objective reality;\\nit has no objective value. Take this green piece\\nof paper, the dollar bill. Look at it -- it has no value. You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it, you cannot wear it. But then came along\\nthese master storytellers -- the big bankers, the finance ministers, the prime ministers -- and they tell us a very convincing story: \"Look, you see this green piece of paper? It is actually worth 10 bananas.\" And if I believe it, and you believe it, and everybody believes it, it actually works. I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to the supermarket, give it to a complete stranger\\nwhom I\\'ve never met before, and get, in exchange, real bananas\\nwhich I can actually eat. This is something amazing. You could never do it with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees trade, of course: \"Yes, you give me a coconut,\\nI\\'ll give you a banana.\" That can work. But, you give me\\na worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana? No way! What do you think I am, a human? (Laughter) Money, in fact, is\\nthe most successful story ever invented and told by humans, because it is the only story\\neverybody believes. Not everybody believes in God, not everybody believes in human rights, not everybody believes in nationalism, but everybody believes in money,\\nand in the dollar bill. Take, even, Osama Bin Laden. He hated American politics\\nand American religion and American culture, but he had no objection\\nto American dollars. He was quite fond of them, actually. (Laughter) To conclude, then: We humans control the world\\nbecause we live in a dual reality. All other animals live\\nin an objective reality. Their reality consists\\nof objective entities, like rivers and trees\\nand lions and elephants. We humans, we also live\\nin an objective reality. In our world, too, there are rivers\\nand trees and lions and elephants. But over the centuries, we have constructed on top\\nof this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality, a reality made of fictional entities, like nations, like gods,\\nlike money, like corporations. And what is amazing is that\\nas history unfolded, this fictional reality became\\nmore and more powerful so that today, the most powerful\\nforces in the world are these fictional entities. Today, the very survival of rivers\\nand trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes\\nof fictional entities, like the United States, like Google,\\nlike the World Bank -- entities that exist only\\nin our own imagination. Thank you. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have\\na new book out. After Sapiens, you wrote another one, and it\\'s out in Hebrew, but not\\nyet translated into ... Yuval Noah Harari: I\\'m working on\\nthe translation as we speak. BG: In the book, if I\\nunderstand it correctly, you argue that the amazing breakthroughs\\nthat we are experiencing right now not only will potentially\\nmake our lives better, but they will create -- and I quote you -- \"... new classes and new class struggles,\\njust as the industrial revolution did.\" Can you elaborate for us? YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution, we saw the creation of a new class\\nof the urban proletariat. And much of the political and social\\nhistory of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class,\\nand the new problems and opportunities. Now, we see the creation of a new\\nmassive class of useless people. (Laughter) As computers become better and better\\nin more and more fields, there is a distinct possibility that\\ncomputers will out-perform us in most tasks and will make\\nhumans redundant. And then the big political\\nand economic question of the 21st century will be, \"What do we need humans for?\", or at least, \"What do we need\\nso many humans for?\" BG: Do you have an answer in the book? YNH: At present, the best guess\\nwe have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games ... (Laughter) but this doesn\\'t sound\\nlike a very appealing future. BG: Ok, so you\\'re basically saying\\nin the book and now, that for all the discussion\\nabout the growing evidence of significant economic inequality,\\nwe are just kind of at the beginning of the process? YNH: Again, it\\'s not a prophecy; it\\'s seeing all kinds\\nof possibilities before us. One possibility is this creation\\nof a new massive class of useless people. Another possibility is\\nthe division of humankind into different biological castes, with the rich being upgraded\\ninto virtual gods, and the poor being degraded\\nto this level of useless people. BG: I feel there is another TED talk\\ncoming up in a year or two. Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip. YNH: Thanks! (Applause)']\n"

In the seventies, it was punk music\\nthat drove the whole generation. In the eighties, it was probably money. But for my generation of people, software is the interface\\nto our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically, radically\\nmore diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical\\nand lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things\\nthat they can tinker and turn around and twist,\\nand so forth. My personal journey into the world\\nof programming and technology started at the tender age of 14. I had this mad teenage crush\\non an older man, and the older man in question\\njust happened to be the then Vice President\\nof the United States, Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single\\nteenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow\\nexpress all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here. And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook,\\nthere was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express\\nall of this longing and loving. And that is how programming\\nstarted for me. It started as a means of self-expression. Just like when I was smaller,\\nI would use crayons and legos. And when I was older, I would use\\nguitar lessons and theater plays. But then, there were other boys,\\nother things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers\\nare boring and technical and lonely. Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good\\nat concentrating on things and being exact and they ask\\namazing questions like, \\\"What?\\\" and \\\"Why?\\\"\\nand \\\"How?\\\" and \\\"What if?\\\" And they don't know that they\\nare not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science\\nis this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed\\nfrom everyday life as, say, nuclear physics. And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax\\nand controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community,\\nwe've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers\\nof abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer\\nhave any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids\\nhow the human body works, we teach them how\\nthe combustion engine functions and we even tell them\\nthat if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks, \\\"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?\\\" Or, \\\"How does the computer know\\nwhat happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?\\\" Or, \\\"Linda, is Internet a place?\\\" We adults, we grow oddly silent. \\\"It's magic,\\\" some of us say. 'It's too complicated,\\\" the others say. Well, it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened\\nreally, really, really fast. Computer scientists built\\nthese amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them\\nvery, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak\\nto the computers so that we don't know\\nhow to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces. And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating\\nFrench irregular verbs, I was actually practicing\\nmy pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following\\na sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language\\nbetween English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer, but no one knew it. The kids of today, they tap, swipe\\nand pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools\\nto build with computers, we are raising only consumers\\ninstead of creators. And I believe that,\\nif JavaScript is the new lingua franca, instead of grammar lessons,\\nwe should be teaching poetry classes. This whole quest\\nled me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. She is completely fearless,\\nimaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time\\nI would run into a problem in trying to teach\\nmyself programming like, \\\"What is object-oriented design\\nor what is garbage collection?\\\", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old\\nlittle girl would explain the problem. And I wrote a book about her\\nand I illustrated it and the things\\nRuby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're\\nnot supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems\\nstuck together. And Ruby also introduced\\nme to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want\\nto play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots\\nthat are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient,\\nbut somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes, and so on. In Ruby's world, you learn\\ntechnology through play. And, for instance, computers\\nare really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach\\nloops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move,\\nit goes, \\\"Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump.\\\" And you learn counter loops\\nby repeating that four times. And you learn while loops\\nby repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops\\nby repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) You learn decomposition skills\\nby problem solving flow charts and seeing what went wrong\\nin Ruby's friends' practicalities. You learn that algorithms\\nare much like cupcake recipes. And most of all, you learn\\nthat there are no ready answers. When coming up with the curriculum\\nfor Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids\\nhow they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize\\nplay testing sessions. I have three little stories for you\\nfrom those play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids\\nthese four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. And I would ask, \\\"Which one of these\\ndo you think is a computer?\\\" And the kids would be\\nvery conservative and go, \\\"None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad\\nspends way too much time.\\\" But then we would talk and we would discover\\nthat actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog - a dog\\nmight not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have\\na computer inside of it. And grocery stores, they have\\nso many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system\\nand the burglar alarms. And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. (Laughter) And we go further and I give them these little stickers\\nwith an on/off button on them. And I tell the kids,\\n\\\"Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room\\ninto a computer.\\\" And again, the kids go, \\\"Sounds really hard,\\nI don't know the right answer for this.\\\" But I tell them, \\\"Don't worry, your parents don't know\\nthe right answer, either. They've just started\\nto hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids,\\nyou are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world\\nwhere everything is a computer.\\\" Your washing machine, toothbrush,\\neven your milk bottle. And that you're the last generation\\nthat will remember the computer as a glowing box. And then I had this little girl\\nwho came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, \\\"This bicycle lamp,\\nif it were a computer, it would change colors.\\\" And I said, \\\"That's a really good idea,\\nwhat else could it do?\\\" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, \\\"If this bicycle lamp\\nwere a computer, we could go on a biking trip\\nwith my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp\\ncould also be a movie projector.\\\" And that's the moment I'm looking for, not the moment when the kid writes\\nthe prefect Ruby array, the moment when the kid realizes that the world\\nis definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way\\nof making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us\\ncan be a part of that change. Final story, we also built a computer, the glowing box,\\nthe archaic glowing box. And we got to know the bossy CPU\\nand the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we've assembled\\nour computer together, we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world\\nis to be an astronaut. And the boy, he has\\nthese huge headphones on and he's completely immersed\\nin his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary\\nnavigation application. And his father, the lone astronaut\\nin the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father\\nsafely back to earth. And these kids are going to have\\na profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology. Finally, the more approachable,\\nthe more inclusive, and the more diverse\\nwe make the world of technology, the more colorful and better\\nthe world will look like. Because disruption\\ndoesn't start with technology. Disruption starts\\nwith the people with a vision. And computer science, and programming\\nand technology the very DNA of all of these things\\nis humanity. Computers, after all,\\nthey used to be humans who were really, really good\\nat calculating things. And still today, programmers\\ndon't write the code only for the machine to execute. They write the code for other\\nprogrammers to read and build upon. So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made\\ndon't only include the twentysomething-year-old\\nSilicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls\\nand Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where\\nthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent\\nreality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic\\nand brave about technology. They embrace the powers\\nand the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology\\nthat is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird. When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings\\nin Moominvalley. In the afternoons,\\nI would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings,\\nI would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out\\nto be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories, I do them with code. Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules\\nand paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing\\nwith the pure power of logic. And that probably makes me a poet. Thank you. (Applause)\",\n          \"I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960. I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I've done during my first five TEDTalks. Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box. This box contains one billion people. And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people. In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people. And they lived away then. There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world. In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families. And their aspiration was to buy a car. And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this. This was the economic level at which Sweden was. But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day. They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes. There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up. And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about \\\"the West\\\" and \\\"the Developing World.\\\" But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population. Just look how many. The world population has doubled since I went to school. And of course, there's been economic growth in the West. A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here. And now their aspiration is not only to have a car. Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly. So this is where they are today. And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them. They are now buying cars. And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world. (Laughter) So there they are. And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago. The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have. And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also. But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap. But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever. But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle. This is the new world we have today in 2010. And what will happen in the future? Well, I'm going to project into 2050. I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did. All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent. [But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here. They will start flying. And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically. And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here. And they will start to buy electric cars. This is what we will find there. So what about the poorest two billion? What about the poorest two billion here? Will they move on? Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end. Here [among the poorest], population is growing. So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion. There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening. Because we already have this [growth] in process. But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050. We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth. And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology. Here I have on the screen my country bubbles. Every bubble is a country. The size is population. The colors show the continent. The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia. That's India and this is China. Size is population. Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families. The year is 1960. And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries. But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival. What has happened? I start the world. Here we go. Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing? They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning. Family size is decreasing. [When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families]. Look, Bangladesh catching up with India. The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion. Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here? They are still up here. And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation. And the population will double in one generation. So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent. That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world. We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things. Child survival is the new green. It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth. And will it happen? Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist. I'm a very serious \\\"possibilist.\\\" It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world. It can be done. We can have a much more just world. With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty, and global governance, the world can become like this. And look at the position of the old West. Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life. This will not happen [again]. The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less. But it's a very important role. Do it well and get used to it. Thank you very much. (Applause)\",\n          \"I was born during a war that still engulfs\\nmy country, Afghanistan. When I was growing up,\\nviolence was all around me. I remember sitting\\nin my living room with my family when a distant thud\\nwould jerk us all out of our seats. As the sound of the rockets\\ncame closer and closer, our bodies would coil and freeze. My grandmother would take charge\\nof her terrified flock and shepherd us into a room\\nin the back of the house. No less exposed, but to us,\\nit somehow felt safer. I'd cling to my granny and clench my fists wondering why this was happening to us. I clearly remember\\nmy little brother's face wincing every time we heard a rocket fall. It was this violence, this war that still goes on today, which forced my family to leave our home. We left early one morning\\nnot knowing where we would end up. Along the way, there was more violence. We drove on roads with landmines, and everywhere we went,\\nthere was hostility. The overriding memory\\nin my body of those years is of feeling unsafe. Feeling as though something terrible\\nwould happen to me or to my family. We worried about our friends\\nand family back home. My grandmother was still in Kabul,\\nand I missed her terribly. I'd go to bed at night\\nand say the prayers she taught me to pray for her safety. We wanted nothing more\\nthan to go back home. But when the Taliban took over\\nthe country in 1996, my parents realized\\nthat was no longer an option. So after four years of living in exile, we sought asylum in the UK\\nand began a new life. I started going to school. And almost 25 years later,\\nI'm standing here with you. I'm now working to help others\\novercome devastation by war. To overcome the trauma\\nof being expendable. In my work, I see how living under constant\\nthreat of violence and feeling unsafe can affect people, even when they manage to get out. War leaves a physical legacy in our body, our mind and in our spirit. When I tell people about my life, they sometimes say\\nit's a remarkable story. But this is not true. Millions of people are living\\nthrough war and displacement, trying to survive. For these people, like my family, the dream isn't to get rich or to go on vacations\\nor to buy that perfect house. They have a modest, yet somehow still extravagant\\ndream of being safe. They dream of a day\\nwhen they can go to the market without the fear of violence. Or send their kids to school without being afraid for their lives. War is dislocating. It gets inside your body\\nand makes you into a thing, a corpse. It can dislodge empathy, hope and joy and replace them with fear. The fear that comes from living\\nin the violence of war can break social bonds, disbanding the very communities\\nwe rely on for safety. Women and children I work with\\ncomplain about pain in their body. Children as young as three or four\\ntalk about hurt in their bellies and not because they're hungry. It's a pain I know well. A constant, dull ache all over your body, and it feels as though nothing\\ncan alleviate it. People have nightmares\\nand experience overwhelming emotions: grief, sadness and anger. \\\"Why did I deserve this,\\\" they wonder. This is the situation facing 84 million\\nforcibly displaced people. And according to UNHCR,\\nmore than half are women and children. What's even more startling is the number of people\\nliving in active conflict zones. According to Save the Children, 420 million children are growing up\\nin places where violence is the norm. These are families and children\\nsubject to forces they cannot control. Yet war and violence don't become normal. The stress and trauma experienced\\nby people who go through war is itself deadly. Illnesses like cancer, diabetes and heart disease have been linked to trauma\\nand chronic stress. But it's the psychic pain\\nthat affects people the most. Depression, PTSD\\nand other psychiatric disorders affect a significant percentage\\nof people who go through war. I was shocked when I learned\\nthat since 9/11, four times more US soldiers\\nhave taken their own lives than died in combat. Reconciling to normal life\\nafter you've seen life-shattering war can be the hardest of tasks\\nfor a human being. But mental health and healing\\nare often overlooked when supporting people\\nwho have survived war. And that's why I set up\\nRefugee Trauma Initiative, to help support the mental health\\nof those affected by war and displacement. Our organization is one of several\\naround the world that helps people so they can begin to feel safe again. When feeling safe is splintered and you feel unsafe and unseen, we work to help bring\\nthe internal safe system back online. We create spaces where people can convene and heal as a community. In our groups, men, women and children\\nreconnect with their bodies, have the space to express\\nwhat they are feeling, and most importantly, reconnect with others. We use art, mindfulness, dance and storytelling to help make sense of the dislocating\\nexperiences of violence and of being forced to leave your home. And everything that we do\\nis underpinned by value-based practice. We practice understanding, curiosity and respect to everyone\\nwho comes through the door. We recognize and acknowledge their trauma without pathologizing or medicalizing\\ntheir very normal human reaction to the reckless violence\\nthey've experienced. And we recognize that these experiences\\nare the result of systemic injustice and oppression that often\\nhave colonial roots, which has dehumanized\\nand killed people for centuries. At the heart of our work is a simple\\nyet fundamental notion that feelings of safety are inextricably tied to feeling\\nconnected to a community. A community where you feel\\nworthy and seen. Where your suffering\\nwill be recognized and cared for, where you can experience belonging. Understanding how violence and conflict\\naffects and changes people is more important than ever. Our world is embroiled\\nin multiple chronic conflicts that seem to have no end in sight. Since 1945, there have been 150\\nconflicts around the world, and the overwhelming majority\\nof casualties have been civilians. We can't talk about this human toll of war without talking about the war industry. The war on terror over the last 20 years\\nunleashed a new kind of violence, displacing 38 million people. This is a war that made\\ndrone warfare the norm. Drones enable automated extermination. As we are moving closer and closer\\ntowards automation of war, what happens when we outsource violence, the extinguishing of a human life, to a computer? What happens to us\\nas an interconnected global community when a machine and not a human decides whether a life is worth something? This is all bleak, but not hopeless. There's always room to adjust\\nour trajectory to a better future. I'm standing here in the most powerful\\ncountry in the world, a citizen of the United Kingdom, two countries that have long\\nheld power over war and peace. And the first thing that we can do is demand that our governments\\nstop investing in mass destruction. At a time when we need to invest\\nin tackling climate change and in health care, our governments are financing\\nweapons and drones. Every vote that we cast should be\\nagainst weapons of mass destruction, against automation of war. (Applause) And you can do something\\nin your own community. Right now, there are literally\\nmillions of Afghans who are brutally forced\\nto leave their home. Like them, there are Syrians,\\nIraqis, Burundians who all have to deal with the fallout\\nof war and displacement. And the antidote to their suffering\\nlies in the kindness and connection of the communities\\nwhere they find themselves. If they can feel safe there, they can begin to heal and start a new life. It's sometimes hard for us to see that the answers to some of the most\\ncomplicated problems in the world lie in the simplest of human actions. It may sound too easy that a good neighbor can help\\nto heal the wounds of war. But in my experience, this is true. Before we landed in London,\\nafter months of hardship, we stopped in a poor neighborhood\\nof a town in Central Asia. I was forlorn, grief stricken and not yet able to imagine\\na future without violence. One day, a neighborhood teacher\\nknocked on our door. When we opened the door, we saw a kindly middle-aged woman carrying a box of pens, colored pencils, paper and children's books. She asked my parents if she could come in\\nand spend time with us. They let her in, and from that day, she visited us most days after school. When I told her that I desperately\\nwanted to go to school, she took me to her classroom, where the girls had prepared gifts. They taught me how to sing a song. It wasn't long before we had to move on, and once we left, I never saw her again. But what she did\\nmade me feel valued and safe. The memory of that experience\\nhad left a blueprint of what it felt to inhabit my body, if only for a moment, without fear. A memory of joy and belonging. And to this day, when I feel the opposite, I can close my eyes\\nand feel that connection. And it carries me through the dark days. Thank you.
